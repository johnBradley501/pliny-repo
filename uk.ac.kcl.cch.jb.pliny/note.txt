====================================================================
Teseting out drag and drop into a container

does not work.

One possible problem is mis-assigning of policies to the parts.  Note, 
for example that ResourceObjectsContainerEditPolicy which is associated
with the orphaning of parts is associated with MapContentHolderPart and
RootResourcePart, but apparently not LinkableObjectPart.

====================================
attempt to add DirectEdit support to GEF's tree part objects

defined new class DirectEditManagerForAbstractEditParts
changed "source" from GraphicalEditPart to AbstractEditPart

a possible serious problem, AncestorListener code no longer can
work -- this is part of a GraphicalEditPart, but not AbstractEditPart

defined new class AbstractDirectEditableTreeEditPart
extending AbstractTreeEditPart, and adding abstract definitions for
same two methods defined in IDirectEditablePart
