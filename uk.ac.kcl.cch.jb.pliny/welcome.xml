<item><b>Introduction to Pliny</b> 
  The Pliny Note Manager is a tool intended to help you create and manage
  notes about things that you read. To learn more about Pliny check 
  <topic id="/uk.ac.kcl.cch.jb.pliny/toc.xml">Pliny's help pages</topic>. 
  </item>
<item><b>Pliny's tutorials</b> 
  Several tutorials about how to use Pliny are included in the help pages.
  If this is your first exposure to Pliny I would suggest that you take a look
  at these.  They can be found in 
  <topic id="/uk.ac.kcl.cch.jb.pliny/toc.xml" href="html/ref.plinyTutorials.html">Pliny's tutorial pages</topic>. 
  </item>
<item><b>Pliny's Perspective</b>
  If you are using Pliny from within Eclipse (rather than "standalone"), it is best used within its own Eclipse "perspective".
  (The term "perspective" is used here in the Eclipse sense: as a screen layout).  You can launch it
  by clicking
<action pluginId="uk.ac.kcl.cch.jb.pliny" class="uk.ac.kcl.cch.jb.pliny.actions.OpenPlinyPerspectiveAction">here</action>.
