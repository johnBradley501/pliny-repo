      <h1><a name="d1e1461">1.2.2 Using Pliny with Non-digital Materials</a></h1>
      <p>As you probably know by now, Pliny is a tool to assist you in annotation
         		and note taking, and perhaps it is natural to think of using Pliny to annotate
         		digital resources such as PDF files or web pages -- indeed the first tutorial
         		(<a href="tut.plinyWithWeb.html">Using Pliny with Web-based materials</a>) has
         		already described how this might be done. In this section we will show you how
         		Pliny can be useful even in situations where the material you are reading is
         		not in a digital form so you cannot do digital annotation. As you will shortly
         		see, you can still use use Pliny to record notes about what we are reading.
         		This section will show you how this is done, and along the way, suggest a
         		strategy you might use to make the note taking most efficient.
      </p>
      <p>Pliny also allows you to import notes that you have previously created
         		in a plain text file. This approach might be useful if you were using, say, a
         		hand-held unit to record notes as you read and didn't have the full Pliny
         		system available. See details in the section <i>Importing Data</i> in the
         		materials about the <a href="ref.resourceExplorer.html">Resource
            		Explorer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>If you are starting up Pliny for the first time you will find that Pliny
         		will have some setting up tasks to do and the startup will take a little longer
         		than usual. If you are using Pliny in its standalone format you will probably
         		next see Pliny's "welcome screen" which you should close once you are ready to
         		begin to use Pliny. When the setup is finished Eclipse will provide you with a
         		screen layout similar to the following:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/first-screen.gif"></p>
      <p>You have put no data into Pliny yet, so there isn't very much to see
         		(eventually, the Pliny screen will contain many more things than you are seeing
         		here -- a general introduction to issues about how Pliny lays out things on the
         		screen can be found in the help section <a href="getting.started.html">Getting
            		Started with <i>Pliny</i></a>). However, Pliny's menu and its tool bars
         		appear in the top area of the Pliny window, where you might expect such things
         		to be (on the Macintosh, the menu appears, instead, in its usual place for the
         		Macintosh, at the top of the screen). Pliny is also designed to start up with
         		<i>Resource Explorer</i> showing down the left side of the window, although
         		because we have done nothing with Pliny yet there really isn't much to see
         		there either.
      </p>
      <p>Let us begin. For the purposes of this tutorial we will assume that you
         		are reading the article "The Computer and the Concept of Text" by Susan Wittig
         		(CHUM Vol 11 pp 211-215). The first stage of scholarly research supported by
         		Pliny is in the recording of notes about what you are reading. We start by
         		creating a bibliography note about the article itself.
      </p>
      <h2>The first Note</h2>
      <p>Pliny provides several different ways to create notes, depending upon
         		  the context in which you are operating. The very first note in Pliny, however,
         		  is most readily created using the New Note button
         		  <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> found in the Resource Explorer's
         		  toolbar. When it is pushed the Resource Explorer will display a its <i>New
            		  Note</i> box (called a <i>Wizard</i> in Eclipse terminology):
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-new-note.gif"></p>
      <p>In Pliny notes are a kind of <i>resource</i>, and resources must have
         		  <i>names</i> so that they can be referenced. The New Note Screen asks us to
         		  provide a name for the note we are creating. Since we have decided to use this
         		  first note to contain bibliographic information about the piece we are reading,
         		  it makes sense to use this new note's name as a brief bibliographic citation --
         		  here this could be a Harvard-style citation: "Wittig 1978".
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-new-note-2.gif"></p>
      <p>The resource explorer provides a mechanism whereby any further notes
         		  we make will be automatically linked (in ways we will see shortly) to this
         		  note. The note to which the other notes are linked is called the "referent".
         		  Since we are going to be making notes about what we read from this article
         		  next, this is a useful thing to do. To set it up, click the "Make referent?"
         		  tick box.
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-new-note-3.gif"></p>
      <p>When we are finished reading the Wittig piece and do not wish to
         		  automatically link more notes to this one, we can clear the referent operation,
         		  or set it to operate to support the next piece we are reading.
      </p>
      <p>You will have noted that there is a third option in the wizard screen
         		  -- "Add to Bookmark list?". We will introduce this item later in this tutorial.
         		  For now, leave the item unchecked. Thus, after you have provided the name and
         		  chosen the referent option click on the "Finish" button in the bottom right
         		  corner. Pliny will respond by creating the note you have requested and
         		  displaying it in the editor panel. Here you can see the results, with parts of
         		  the editor panel labelled below:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/first-note-wittig-1978.gif"></p>
      <p>Several things have changed on the screen, and it is worthwhile taking
         		  a moment to have them pointed out: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>The resource explorer has changed the symbol to the left of the
               			 Note heading to a small arrow symbol, reflecting the fact that there are now
               			 notes (well, one anyway!) being held by Pliny, and
            </li>
            <li>the main editor pane now shows the newly created <i>Wittig 1978</i>
               			 note. We will describe what is there in more detail almost immediately.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The editor pane that was previously grey now contains what is called
         		  in Pliny terminology the <b>Note Editor</b> for <i>Wittig 1978</i>. The Noted
         		  Editor divides its editor pane into several areas, labelled above. Three of
         		  these parts reflect the fact that a note in Pliny has three major parts, (a) a
         		  <i>name</i>, (b) some textual <i>content</i>, and (c) a <i>reference area</i>. 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>At the very top of the pane is a tab showing the name of the note
               			 currently available in the editor panel.
            </li>
            <li>Directly below the tab is the <b>Pliny Toolbar</b>, which contains
               			 a text field, and various buttons and icons. These will be explained
               			 shortly.
            </li>
            <li>Within the Pliny Toolbar is the <b>Note's Name Field</b>: Here,
               			 unlike in the tab above, the name can be edited. If, for example, you had made
               			 a typing mistake while typing in the name earlier in the New Note wizard you
               			 could correct it here. To the left of the note name field is the now familiar
               			 note icon <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">. This instance of the
               			 icon is useful in certain drag and drop operations from here to other places
               			 supported by Pliny, and its use will be described elsewhere.
            </li>
            <li>In the left area below the Pliny Toolbar is the <b>Note Content
                  			 Field</b>: This is the place where you can type in the <i>content</i> of the
               			 note. Click in it to get a typing cursor, and type in the bibliographic
               			 reference for the Wittig article: 
               			 
               <blockquote><tt>Susan Wittig (1978). The computer and the Concept of Text. In
                     				  Computers and the Humanities Vol 11 pp 211-215.<br></tt></blockquote> 
               			 
               <p>Since this is a bibliographic entry you will likely feel the urge
                  				to try to make the name of the journal display in italics. Surprisingly,
                  				perhaps, Pliny makes no provision for such a thing. (If I'd had significantly
                  				more time to develop Pliny, support for the formatting of note contents could
                  				be provided.) However, Pliny is not, after all, a word processor, and as I
                  				think you will see that in time, a long, complex and formatted bit of text in
                  a
                  				note is actually a hint that you are using Pliny in ways that you will
                  				eventually see as ineffective. So, for now, and admittedly with regret, we move
                  				on after acknowledging that we cannot highlight text in a note and that
                  				eventually we will find out why it is less of an issue than it might
                  				seem.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>Also below the Pliny Toolbar, but at the right hand end is
               			 the<b>Note Reference Area</b>: This is the place where other resources that you
               			 wish to associated with this note can be recorded. We will discuss how to use
               			 this area shortly. There is extensive description about how the reference area
               			 works in the section <a href="ref.annotationArea.html">Annotation/Reference
                  			 Area</a>, but I suggest that if this is your first look at Pliny that you
               			 continue with the discussion in this section, and look at the detailed
               			 information at a later time.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Note that the boundary between the note body area and the note
         		  annotation area can be moved left or right. To do so place the mouse pointer
         		  over the boundary. The pointer should change to
         		  <img align="middle" src="images/horiz-resize-pointer.jpg">. Depress the main mouse
         		  button and drag the boundary to where you want it to be. The new position is
         		  associated with the information Pliny keeps about this note, and the boundary
         		  will be placed where you have put it any time you look at this note in the
         		  future.
      </p>
      <p>After you have typed in the note and moved the boundary between the
         		  note and the annotation area a little to the left, you should see something
         		  like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-1978-2.gif"></p>
      <p>The first note, which is acting at present like a bibliographic
         		  reference to the article, has been created, and we are now ready to start
         		  reading the text and recording some of our responses to it.
      </p>
      <p>If you read the previous tutorial (<a href="tut.plinyWithWeb.html">Using
            		  Pliny with Web-based materials</a>) which showed you now to attach notes to a
         		  web page you already know one way to proceed. The <i>Wittig 1978</i> note we
         		  have just created has a reference area in the right-hand part of its editor
         		  panel and it works in exactly the same way as the reference area does in
         		  Pliny's web browser. Thus, you can simply create new notes in there to record
         		  your observations as you read Wittig's article in exactly the same way you did
         		  in the previous tutorial -- by clicking on the New Note icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">) in the Note Editors's Pliny Toolbar,
         		  dragging from this same New Note icon onto the reference area, or pushing the
         		  F5 key as a shortcut, drawing out a new note area and typing your thoughts into
         		  it. There is, however, an alternative mechanism using the "Referent" paradigm
         		  that we set up for this note, and that can be more efficient -- particularly
         		  when, at first, you don't wish to take the time and mental energy to organise
         		  the references to the new notes you create on the screen. In the previous
         		  section of this tutorial we have already set up the "referent" mechanism when
         		  we clicked on the "Make referent" tickbox while we created the <i>Wittig
            		  1978</i> note. In this next section we make use of the "referent" mechanism we
         		  set up in this way.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating notes about the text using a Referent</h2>
      <p>As you read this text you will discover things you wish to record in
         		  Pliny about it. Suppose that as your first note you wish to record Wittig's
         		  observation that traditional computer-based text analysis tools seem to operate
         		  within the conceptual framework of the <i>New Criticism</i> -- a point Wittig
         		  makes on page 211. 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>Start by pushing the <i>New Note</i> button (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">) <b>in the Resource Explorer pane</b> again
               			 (you might well see the same Icon in other places on the screen, but these are
               			 for other purposes that we will explain later). Once again the New Note Wizard
               			 will appear:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/re-new-note-4.gif"></p>
            </li>
            <li>This time Pliny has suggested a name for this note -- taking the
               			 name from the note you created before, and adding some further, rather
               			 nondescript, text "Note 1". It knows to relate this new note to the previous
               			 one because, if you remember, we asked Pliny to make our first note the current
               			 "referent", and this is one of the things Pliny does when a note is so
               			 designated. If you wished to make the title of the note more significant you
               			 could change it here before pushing the "Finish" button, but for now we will
               			 push "Finish" -- and will fix the name to make it more meaningful shortly.
            </li>
            <li>As a result, Pliny will create a second note and display it to you:
               			 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-note2.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>Note that the right hand <i>reference area</i> in the note window
                  				is not completely empty this time -- it contains what in Pliny terminology is
                  				called a <i>reference</i> -- in this case to the first note we created called
                  				"Wittig 1978". Again, this is one of the results of making "Wittig 1978" the
                  				<i>referent</i> note. By putting this reference in here Pliny is providing us
                  				with a reminder that this note was created as a response to the article
                  				described in the reference note "Wittig 1978". We will see later that a second
                  				consequence of making Wittig 1978 a referent is that it will also receive a
                  				reference object from this note to it -- effectively establishing a
                  				connection/reference in both directions.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>Now the note is ready for our comment. Here we decide to quote a
               			 bit of Wittig, and we type our note into its <i>Content Field</i>: the white
               			 area below and to the right of the Pliny toolbar:
               			 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-note2-a.gif"></p>
            </li>
            <li>Having now typed in this note we decide what its title should be:
               			 "CBLA and New Criticism" (CBLA stands for "Computer Based Literary Analysis").
               			 We can change the name of the note since the name area can be typed in. We
               			 shall replace the "Note 1" text with our new title. Thus, we first drag with
               			 the mouse over the relevent text in the note's title field in the Note
               			 Editror's Pliny Toolbar: 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-note2-b.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>... and, as one would when working in a word processor, type in
                  				the new title to replace it. When we are finished typing in the new title we
                  				indicate that we are not planning to make any more changes in the field by
                  				clicking the mouse somewhere else on the screen. At that point the note name is
                  				changed, and the tab at the top of the screen will be changed as well to
                  				reflect this:
               </p> 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-note2-c.gif"></p>
            </li>
            <li>This first note we have made as we read <i>Wittig 1978</i> is now
               			 finished.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>As we continue to read Wittig's article we can use the same mechanism
         		  we have just described over and over again to put new notes into Pliny -- click
         		  on the <i>New Note</i> icon in the Resource Explorer to ask for a new note,
         		  edit the title if we wish, and type our thought into the note's content
         		  area.
      </p>
      <h2>Organising Notes</h2>
      <p>After we have finished reading Wittig's article we will have put in a
         		  number of notes. For each note we have created Pliny will have created a new
         		  item in the editor pane, and there is likely to be several tabs (as many as
         		  will fit) at the top of the editor pane: 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-1.png"></p>
      <p>In this figure the tab area is small, so only three tabs are showing,
         		  but the number 2 after the chevron ("<tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>" -- shown just to the
         		  right of the tabs themselves) shows that there are two more items open here
         		  that do not have tabs showing. We want to move back to the "Wittig 1978" note
         		  we first created. There are several ways to do this. If the name of our first
         		  note appeared among the tab list at the top we need merely click on the tab to
         		  bring it to the front. If it is not there, however, the best way at present is
         		  to click on the chevron item, and click on its name in the list that then
         		  appears:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-2.png"></p>
      <p>The material associated with the first note is brought to the front,
         		  and we can immediately see that changes have been made there by Pliny while
         		  we've been typing in our other notes about Wittig:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-3.png"></p>
      <p>The first note still has its textual content -- showing in the left
         		  area --exactly as we have left it, but we can see that its right-hand reference
         		  area now has several objects in it -- in fact there are 5 items there (one for
         		  each note we created with <i>Wittig 1978</i> as the referent), although we can
         		  see only 4 at present because of the size of the window. They are here as a
         		  consequence of the <i>referent</i>action we requested near the beginning of
         		  this tutorial. When a referent has been specified and is currently in
         		  operation, Pliny automatically creates a reference as a link in both directions
         		  -- to and from the referent to each new note.
      </p>
      <p>As you might recall, each of these boxes is called a <i>reference</i>
         		  in Pliny since the box <i>refers</i> to a note stored in the system. If we look
         		  at the first reference at the top of the reference area we can see that it
         		  displays the name of the first note we created -- "Wittig 1978: CBLA and New
         		  Criticism" -- in a dark green header area, and then some portion of the body of
         		  the note in a lighter green area below. Pliny has rather arbitrarily set the
         		  size of the entire reference so that, as it turns out, not all the textual
         		  content of the note can be seen -- so it also displays a scroll-bar at the
         		  right hand end of the lighter green area so that we can scroll the text and see
         		  what appears below what is initially visible. There is extensive information
         		  about references and reference objects <a href="ref.referenceObject.html">elsewhere</a> in this documentation, but I suggest
         		  that if you are reading this tutorial for the first time that you continue
         		  reading here instead, and consult it at a later point.
      </p>
      <p>Here the reference is coloured green, but you may remember that Pliny
         		  put a reference to <i>Wittig 1978</i> (coloured blue that time rather than the
         		  green we see now) in each note we created. You can think of references as
         		  links. Why is this one green, and the others were blue? The colours are managed
         		  by Pliny's <i>type</i> system, which is described in more detail elsewhere in
         		  these help pages (see the help on the <a href="ref.typeManagerView.html">Type
            		  Manager</a>). For now, it is sufficient to understand that Pliny knows that
         		  the type of reference that points <i>from</i> a note to the source is different
         		  in character from that which points from a source <i>to</i> a note, and the
         		  colour is different to reflect this.
      </p>
      <p>The header area in this reference has had its width set by Pliny so
         		  that it too narrow to see the entire title. If, however, you place the mouse
         		  pointer on the item and leave it there for a moment Pliny will show you the
         		  full name of the item as a tooltip. Although Pliny has initially laid out the
         		  references so that it probably looks to you as if they are represented simply
         		  as a list of reference boxes, in fact, the reference area in which they reside
         		  is actually a 2 dimensional space, and each reference can be both resized and
         		  moved about. Let us resize the first item so that its entire title can be seen.
         		  To do this, click in the dark green title area of the first reference area.
         		  This will cause this first reference to be <i>selected</i>, and as a
         		  consequence, Pliny will display a set of reference handles around the box that
         		  borders the reference area. There are 8 selection handled (in the 4 corners,
         		  and in the middle of each side), and the 3 on the right side of the reference
         		  are identified in this figure:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-3a.gif"></p>
      <p> Extend the width of this selected item by pointing a at the handle
         		  box at the centre of the right end, and dragging it further to the right. Pliny
         		  will expand the reference box to the size we thus indicate, and if we move it
         		  far enough to the right then all the text will be able to be displayed in its
         		  contents. Alternatively, we could have expanded the height of the reference
         		  area bout we would have found that if we did this the reference area would
         		  begin to display over top of the reference area (for <i>Wittig 1978: 3
            		  notions</i>) below it.
      </p>
      <h3>Minimising and moving references in the reference area</h3>
      <p>Although Pliny has laid out the references to the notes we made
         			 about Wittig 1978 as a kind of vertical stack, we can use the 2-dimensional
         			 reference area we find here as a way of grouping and organising the notes to
         			 help us remember what we thought about the article. In the end, we will
         			 recognise the 5 notes we made fit into two broader topics, and we will lay them
         			 out in the reference area, and group them in such a way that this is evident.
         			 Let us begin to set this up now.
      </p>
      <p>The first thing to note about references is that they can be
         			 <i>minimized</i>. When minimized, Pliny displays them in a smaller box with
         			 only the header area showing. The icon in the header area at the extreme right
         			 end (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/closeNote.gif">) is the minimization button,
         			 and when clicked causes Pliny to display this reference in its minimized
         			 state:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-3b.gif"></p>
      <p>When minimized the reference object can still be dragged around in
         			 the reference area, and it's width can be changed -- but its height will always
         			 stay at the size that only displays the header area. Click on the icon at the
         			 extreme end again -- which has now changed to
         			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/openNote.gif"> -- to change its stack back to the
         			 non-minimized size. You can toggle between minimised and un-minimised state as
         			 often as is useful to you in this way. Minimise a reference when you want it to
         			 take up less space in your reference area. You will no longer be able to see
         			 the note's contents when it is minimised but you can, after all, unminimize it
         			 whenever you like, and as we shall see below, you can also "open" <i>it</i> up
         			 in turn into a new editor (by double-clicking on the icon at the left end of
         			 the object) so that you can see it's textual content and reference area in a
         			 separate editor pane.
      </p>
      <p>Let us take advantage of the minimised form for all the references
         			 so that we can make better use of the reference area's space. We could, of
         			 course, click on the minimise icon for each reference in turn to minimise them
         			 all. To achieve the same result more quickly, first type in the "select all"
         			 command (Ctrl-A on a windows machine, Apple-A on a Macintosh) to select all of
         			 the 5 references that are currently present. Then, click with the other mouse
         			 button (or click with the Ctrl key depressed on a one-button Macintosh mouse
         			 button) while the pointer is pointing at any of the then-selected references to
         			 see the contextual menu:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-3c.png"></p>
      <p>The first item displayed here is the "Minimze selected" command.
         			 Click on that to choose it, and all the selected references (in this case, all
         			 of them since we had just done a "select all" command) will be minimised:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-3d.PNG"></p>
      <p>We can still only see four references in this figure, even though we
         			 took 5 notes. Minimizing does not cause Pliny to close up the empty space that
         			 minimising has created -- the reference area is a two dimensional <i>space</i>
         			 rather than a list, after all. Since Pliny has placed the last reference (for
         			 the 5th note) below the viewing area it is still down there. Of course if we
         			 use the scroll bar to scroll down we'll find it.
      </p>
      <p>As we mentioned above, when we have finished reading Wittig's
         			 article we observe our notes fall into two major themes. She starts by
         			 observing the New Criticism flavour of much of the computer assisted text
         			 analysis tools she was familiar with in 1978. The first of our three notes draw
         			 upon that theme. She then puts reading in a semiotics framework and encourages
         			 us to think about computer supported criticism tools that might operate in this
         			 context instead. The other two of our five notes identify this.
      </p>
      <p>First, we drag the boundary between the note contents (with the
         			 bibliographic citation) at the left edge of the editor area and the reference
         			 area to the right so that we increase the size of the reference area. Then we
         			 click somewhere in the reference area so that all the references stop being
         			 selected. Now, we want to drag the references to new locations so that we can
         			 use the visual display are to emphasize that they appear in two groups. To drag
         			 a reference, point somewhere in the reference's title and drag with the mouse.
         			 The reference will follow the pointer around on the screen. Let use this
         			 technique to move the 5 references into two separate areas on the screen:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-8.png"></p>
      <p>As well as moving the items around we have lengthened some of them
         			 so that in all cases the titles we gave to the notes they represent are
         			 visible.
      </p>
      <p>Note that we can take advantage of this grouping to move them all
         			 together as a set by selecting them all (you can drag out an area around (the
         			 area boundary should be started outside of all the items you want to select) a
         			 set of references -- a marquee box will appear) to select a set of items that
         			 are close together), and once selected, they can be moved as a group by
         			 dragging in the way you might expect.
      </p>
      <h3>Grouping by containment</h3>
      <p>The positioning of the items in the reference space implies a
         			 grouping. We can make this more evident by creating two new notes that are
         			 associated with the two topics into which our notes fit, and then we can file
         			 these references into these notes according to which topic they belong. A note
         			 that is used to hold references to other notes is called a <i>containment
            			 object </i>in Pliny.
      </p>
      <p>There are two ways to create containment objects, and we describe
         			 the two techniques below:
      </p>
      <h4>Turning a note into a containment object</h4>
      <p>The first way depends on the fact that any note in Pliny can act
         				as a containment object by controlling how Pliny displays it for us. In this
         				first technique we will: 
         			 
         <ul>
            <li>Create a new note,</li>
            <li>aski Pliny to display it as a containment object, and</li>
            <li>move any object that it is to contain into it.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>We need to start with the first step, then: to create a note (and
         				a reference) that appears <i>in</i> the reference space for this note. To
         				achieve this most readily we should use the <i>New Note</i> icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">) associated with this note editor. All the
         				buttons associated with this editor are found in the right end of the Pliny
         				toolbar, just below the tabs. The exact buttons may vary in different contents,
         				but they will look very much like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-9.gif"></p>
      <p>There are several buttons here. They are described in detail in
         				the <a href="ref.noteEditor.html">reference section</a> for the Note editor. For
         				the moment we will focus on the "New Note" button we find there -- the button
         				with the New Note icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">) Remember
         				that this New Note icon is <i>not</i> the same button that we see in the
         				Resource Explorer, although it has the same icon. Whereas both the New Note
         				icons in the Resource Explorer, and the one here (associated with the note
         				editor) allow you to create a new note, the one associated with the note editor
         				also allows you to immediately place a reference to it in the current reference
         				area as well.
      </p>
      <p>After we push the New Note button Pliny is ready to create a new
         				note (and new reference to it) in the reference space for "Wittig 1978". To
         				then create the note and place the reference in the reference area drag out a
         				rectangle there where you want the reference to sit. When you release the
         				button the new note and its reference will appear:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-10.png"></p>
      <p>Now, we can change the name of the note we just created to reflect
         				the first of the two topics we found in this paper. To do this double click in
         				the reference object's title area (dark green, and currently showing "Wittig
         				1978: Note 6") and type in a new name, say: "Wittig 1978: CBLA: limits of
         				NewCrit base".
      </p>
      <p>We are now ready to do the second step we outlined above: to
         				change this reference area so that it can act as a <i>container</i> for other
         				notes. As you know by now a note has some content text (showing when open in
         				the note editor in the left area) and a 2D reference area (showing in the
         				right). When a reference for a note is first created it shows the title bar and
         				the note's content text area. Here, Pliny reminds us that this reference area
         				is displaying the Note's content by coloring it with a light green background.
         				This newly created note has no content text, so this area is otherwise empty.
         				We could type in some text here by double-clicking in the bottom part of the
         				newly created reference object and typing in what we want to say -- we'll do
         				this later in this tutorial for another note we create. Instead, however, we
         				wish the bottom area of the reference object to show not the note's textual
         				content, but instead the 2D reference area associated with it. To make Pliny do
         				this push the "show reference area" button (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/showMap.gif">) in the title bar area of the reference. This
         				will cause Pliny to show a bit of the 2D reference area of the note "Witting
         				1978: CBLA: limits of NewCrit base". Since we have just created it a moment
         				ago, it will also be empty, so the only visual effect will be that the green
         				background disappears. In addition, the button changes to the "show contents
         				text button" (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/showContents.gif">) so that we can
         				switch back to the textual content area if we wish.
      </p>
      <p>Now that we have the reference/containment area for our new note
         				visible we can carry out the third step described above: drag and drop the
         				three notes related to the theme it represents into that area. We could point
         				at each one in turn and drag it into the open reference area for a new note.
         				Instead, let us do all three all at once: drag a selection retangle around the
         				three notes, point at the title of any one of them, and then in this way drag
         				the three of them into the reference area for our new note in one go. The
         				result will be something like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-11.png"></p>
      <p>The references for the three notes are now contained <i>within</i>
         				the reference area for note "CBLA: limits of newCrit base". In Pliny this type
         				of change is called <i>re-parenting</i> to reflect the hierarchical nature of
         				what we have just done: the three notes had Wittig 1978 as their parent before,
         				but now they have "Witting 1978: CBLA: limits of NewCrit base" as their parent
         				instead. We have dragged items into the "limits..." note's reference area, we
         				could also drag one or more of them out again if we changed our mind about one
         				of the references. When one sees a resource's reference area displayed like
         				this one can move resources between the contained reference area and the
         				containing reference area at will. However, we won't do this right now.
      </p>
      <h4>Using the <i>Group Objects</i> Command
      </h4>
      <p>We can repeat the process for the other two notes -- creating a
         				new thematic note and assigning a name to it, changing its display to show the
         				new note's reference area, and then dragging the two remaining notes into it.
         				There is, however, a faster way to group notes together that is often
         				appropriate: using the <i>Group objects</i> command. Select the two remaining
         				notes that are outside of the "limits of NewCrit base", and click with the
         				other mouse button (or, on a one-button Macintosh mouse, click while holding
         				down the Ctrl key) to see the contextual menu. One of the choices there will be
         				<i>Group Objects</i>:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-11a.png"></p>
      <p>Choose it. A a result, Pliny will do the whole job for us on its
         				own: first, it will create a new note and a reference to it which covers the
         				area containing the currently selected objects, then it will set it up so that
         				the new note's reference area is visible (it becomes a <i>containment</i>
         				object), and finally it will place the selected notes in it -- effectively
         				setting up the containment all in one go:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-11b.png"></p>
      <p>Now we can update our containing note's name to reflect what it
         			 contains. Double click on the name in the new note's title area to open it for
         			 editing, and replace the name with "Wittig 1978: reading and semiotics": 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-12.png"></p>
      <p>We have restructured the five notes we collected with "Wittig 1978"
         			 to remind us that they fall into two major themes -- three in one and two in
         			 the other.
      </p>
      <h3>Adding a comment as a note</h3>
      <p>Having grouped our original notes in this way we find we want to add
         			 a further observation. Let us add a new note into the reference area, and put
         			 the comment in it. We have added a new note and reference object once before
         			 when we created our first containment object. As you might recall, we can do
         			 this by first clicking on the New Note button (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">) associated with the editor (in this toolbar
         			 -- remember, not the one with the Resource Explorer):
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-9.gif"></p>
      <p>Alternatively, we can use the F5 keyboards shortcut to tell Pliny
         			 that we wish to create a new note in the current reference area. Either way,
         			 you can then drag out an area where we want the new note's reference object to
         			 appear:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-13.png"></p>
      <p>Then we can open both the new note's title and content areas (by
         			 double-clicking in each in turn) and type in our comment, resulting in
         			 something like:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/wittig-org-14.png"></p>
      <p>We now have: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>a top note which is showing its textual content, and provides a
               				comment;
            </li>
            <li>a second note which, by appearing as a containment object, is
               				holding three notes that refer to the "limits of the NewCrit base"; and
            </li>
            <li>a second note also appearing as a containment object, and holding
               				our two notes about "reading and semiotics".
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>We have now completed our work with <i>Wittig 1978</i> -- initially
         			 recording our observations about the article in 5 notes, then grouping these
         			 notes into two larger thematic categories, and finally adding a new note into
         			 which we put a kind of overarching comment about Wittig 1978.
      </p>
      <h2>The Resource Explorer</h2>
      <p>Now that we have made a few notes it is time to turn our attention
         		  back again to the Resource Explorer. In Eclipse terminology this is a
         		  <i>view</i>, and the Pliny screen is displaying it in a view pane that
         		  currently happens to be placed on the left side edge of the Pliny screen
         		  (although it could be dragged somewhere else in the Pliny window, or even out
         		  of the Pliny window altogether to display in a window on its own). It looks
         		  currently like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/introRE-1.png"></p>
      <p>We have already noted that as soon as we started creating notes, Pliny
         		  placed a "&gt;" beside the Note folder to indicate that it was now holding some
         		  notes for us. It is now time to examine how the Resource Explorer organises the
         		  objects it holds. (There is more detail about the Resource Explorer's display
         		  in its <a href="ref.resourceExplorer.html">reference section</a>.) 
      </p>
      <p>The first thing to note is that the Resource Explorer displays its
         		  materials hierarchically with the top level being the <i>kind</i> of resource,
         		  and since we have created several notes, the "&gt;" sign indicates that there
         		  is something to see inside the "Note" folder. You can see other folders at the
         		  top level: one called "Web Browser", "Image" and "PDF/Acrobat", representing
         		  the other categories of data that this version of Pliny knows how to work with.
         		  Pliny works with things it calls <i>resources</i>, of which "Notes" are just
         		  one kind of resource. Another kind of resource is the web page, and when we
         		  have web page information managed by Pliny a record of it will appear in the
         		  "Web Browser" folder (see the tutorial <a href="tut.plinyWithWeb.html">Using Pliny
            		  with Web-based materials</a> for more information about using Pliny to work
         		  with web pages as resources). Pliny works out of the box with these kinds of
         		  resources, but it can be extended in various ways to work with other kinds of
         		  digital data, in which case the number of folders will increase here, for the
         		  number of different kinds of resources that Pliny could then handle after it
         		  was extended.
      </p>
      <p>You can see that there is also an object called "My Bookmarks" in the
         		  Resource Explorer. It is not thought of as a resource type folder, and its
         		  purpose and use is briefly described below.
      </p>
      <p>Returning now to the Note folder, if we click on the "&gt;" sign
         		  another level will open up. Pliny groups resources by the first letter of their
         		  names. Since all the resources we have created so far have names which begin
         		  with "W" (for "Wittig"), there will be "W" level with a "&gt;" in front of it
         		  (the number in parentheses following the code tells us how many notes with
         		  names beginning with W there are -- currently 9). If we click on the "+" in
         		  front of the W-folder it will open in turn and we will see all the Notes whose
         		  names begin with "W":
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/introRE-2.png"></p>
      <p>It happens that the pane is not wide enough to show the full name of
         		  all the notes. However, if we place the cursor pointer over one of the names
         		  Pliny will display the full name as a tooltip (here, the cursor sits over the
         		  item "Wittig 1978: CBLA: limits of newCrit base"). If we want to see more
         		  letters in the names in the pane itself we can simply move the boundary between
         		  the Resource Explorer pane and the pane to the right beside it to give the
         		  Resource Explorer more room on the screen:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/introRE-3.png"></p>
      <p>Before we look at how to make use of this list in the Resource
         		  Explorer it is useful to take a moment to observe some of the implications of
         		  how the notes are organised here. We know that we set up <i>Wittig 1978</i> as
         		  the current referent, and that for this reason a note like <i>Wittig 1978:
            		  CBLA: 3 notions</i> was automatically linked to <i>Wittig 1978</i> -- however,
         		  the list the Resource Explorer does not immediately show this connection.
      </p>
      <p>Although we might be tempted to think of the relationship between,
         		  say, the <i>3 notions</i> note and <i>Wittig 1978</i> as hierarchical (Wittig
         		  1978 <i>owning</i> the other notes), it does not appear that way here, and
         		  indeed Pliny relationships are organised so that an hierarchical relationship
         		  is only one of several possible interpretations. Shortly we will see ways to
         		  view the relationships as hierarchical if we wish. Instead, the hierarchical
         		  folder system used in the Resource Explorer works according to rather more
         		  basic system. The top level is always a list of the <i>kinds</i> of resources
         		  that Pliny currently is managing. The second level is always a grouping of
         		  resources, here by initial letter of their name, and the third level is always
         		  groups of individual resources. You cannot, then, use the Resource Explorer to
         		  explore conceptual hierarchies you have created by using containment (as we did
         		  above) between your resources since they are always organised in this three
         		  level relatively flat structure. Instead, think of the Explorer providing you
         		  with a way to see <i>all</i> your resources entirely independantly of the
         		  linking mechanisms you are creating between them, and allowing you to locate
         		  one of them by its name.
      </p>
      <p>You can interact with the list here in several ways: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>First, by double clicking on the <i>icon</i>
               			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> in front of the name of one of the
               			 notes you can ask Pliny to open it for you in the note editor.
            </li>
            <li>Second, by clicking in the <i>name</i> of any note you can open the
               			 name for editing it, and thereby change the name. Note, however, that by
               			 changing the name you will probably cause the item with the altered name to
               			 move around in the list. If, for example, you changed the name of one of the
               			 notes so that it no longer started with "W" then the Resource Explorer would
               			 move the item to a new initial letter folder that reflected the new first
               			 letter of the name as soon as you finished editing it.
            </li>
            <li>Third, you can delete a note you don't want any longer by selecting
               			 it (clicking on it), and then pushing the Delete key or choosing "Delete" from
               			 the "Edit" menu.
            </li>
            <li>Fourth, you can use drag-and-drop to create a reference from this
               			 list in some other open resource's annotation area. We'll see an example of
               			 this later in this tutorial.
            </li>
            <li>Fifth, you can see places where this note refers to other
               			 resources, or other resources refer to it. At present, since there is little
               			 material in the system, this is not perhaps terribly interesting, but as an
               			 example, click on the "&gt;" object in front of "Wittig 1978". You will see two
               			 sub-categories <i>Displayed In</i> and <i>Contains</i> appear. Open them both
               			 by clicking on their "&gt;" object, and you will see:
               			 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/introRE-4.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>The list under <i>Displayed In</i> shows the resources in which a
                  				reference to <i>Wittig 1978</i> appears. The list under <i>Contains</i> shows
                  				the references that <i>Wittig 1978</i> contains itself. <i>Wittig 1978</i>
                  				appears in the 5 notes shown in the list because, as you recall, Pliny had
                  				<i>Wittig 1978</i> set as the referent when they were being created., and so
                  				Pliny automatically put a link from the created note to its referent as a
                  				matter of course. As you will recall, we also created two category notes within
                  				<i>Wittig 1978</i> to the group the notes we made as we read the text, and then
                  				added a third note to hold a comment about our reading. We can see these two
                  				"grouping notes" and the comment in the <i>Contains</i> section for
                  				<i>Wittig</i>. Where are the notes they in turn contain? If we open one of
                  				these two grouping items under the <i>Contains</i> category (say, <i>Wittig
                     				1978: reading and semiotics</i>) we will see the <i>Displayed In</i> and
                  				<i>Contains</i> items for it, and if we opened this <i>Contains</i> item in
                  				turn will see the two items we placed in the <i>reading and semiotics</i> note
                  				earlier in this tutorial. In this way we can take an hierarchical view of our
                  				materials.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Finishing the "Referent" operation</h3>
      <p>We have created our note-taking for <i>Wittig 1978</i>, and so we
         			 should remove the referent setting to it, so that any other notes we
         			 subsequently create will <i>not</i> be automatically assumed to be drawn from
         			 <i>Wittig 1978</i>.
      </p>
      <p>To do this, we can make use of the Resource Explorer's contextual
         			 menu. You will probably recall what a contextual menu is: we invoked it twice
         			 when working in the Reference Area, and you have probably also seen it with
         			 other programs you use. You call up the contextual menu by pushing the other
         			 mouse button (on two button mice) or by holding down the Control key while
         			 clicking (for Macintosh 1-button mice). It appears were the mouse pointer is.
         			 In the Resource Explorer it will look something like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/introRE-5.gif"></p>
      <p>Exactly what items appear on the list will depend upon the context
         			 in which it is clicked). However, since we currently have an active Referent,
         			 the option "Clear the Reference" (highlighted above) will appear. If we click
         			 on it "Wittig 1978" will be the referent no longer and will no longer be
         			 automatically referenced in any new note we create.
      </p>
      <p>Note that if we reread the same article or continue reading it and
         			 find that we want to add more notes we can reinstigate <i>Wittig 1978</i> as
         			 the referent by choosing it in the Resource Explore and then choosing "Set the
         			 Referent" from the contextual menu.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating Bookmarks</h2>
      <p>As you create more and more notes in Pliny you will find that you will
         		  need to organise them so that you can find them again. The Reference Manager's
         		  resource folders allow you to access all the resources you have created, but
         		  doesn't help you organise them very effectively. Suppose, for example, that you
         		  want to keep track of the materials that you have read and for which you have
         		  created notes?
      </p>
      <p>One way to facilitate this is to create a note called something like
         		  <i>My Readings</i>, and store (in the note's reference area) references to the
         		  materials you have read. By putting <i>My Readings</i> as an item accessible
         		  from the the bookmarks list you provide, though it, one convenient entry point
         		  for your resource collection. The folder <i>My Bookmarks</i> provides a place
         		  where we can store high-level note items about the things that we have read
         		  that we will want to consult often in the future.
      </p>
      <p>The steps for creating a bookmark item are: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>First, create the note <i>My Readings</i>. Use the <i>create
                  			 note</i> button (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">) in the Reference
               			 manager, and name the note "<tt>My Readings</tt>" in the New Note wizard that
               			 then appears. Before clicking "Finish", also tick the box beside the label
               			 <i>Add to Bookmark List?</i>, as shown here:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/introRE-6.gif"></p>
            </li>
            <li>Now, push the "Finish" button. As a result, the new note is
               			 created, three things happen on the screen:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/introRE-7.png"></p> 
               			 
               <ul>
                  <li>First, the new note opens in the Eclipse editor pane.</li>
                  <li>Second, the note appears in the "Note" folder of the Resource
                     				  Explorer in the newly created "M" group.
                  </li>
                  <li>Finally, the "My Bookmarks" item in the "Resource Explorer"
                     				  gains a "&gt;" to indicate that it now holds a reference to the note "My
                     				  Readings".
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li> 
               			 
               <p>If we open the "My Bookmarks" item in the Resource Explorer we
                  				will see the item "My Readings" appearing as a bookmark.
               </p>
               			 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/introRE-8.png"></p> 
               			 
               <p>Currently it is the only one, but at a later point in your use of
                  				Pliny you may find you wish to add other entry point notes as Bookmarks as
                  				well. Note what "My Bookmarks" is for: it provides a place to save useful
                  				"entry points" into your collection of Pliny objects. You can think of it as
                  				similar to the bookmark factility provided in your web browser.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>Now we are ready to add a reference to <i>Wittig 1978</i> in our
               			 new <i>My Readings</i> note. It will be the first thing we have read that we
               			 have recorded in Pliny. The easiest way to do this is to use drag-and-drop from
               			 the <i>Wittig 1978</i> entry in the Resource Explorer to the annotation area in
               			 "My Readings". Place the mouse pointer at the <i>Witting 1978</i> entry,
               			 depress the mouse button, and drag from there to some spot in the Reference
               			 area for the <i>My Readings</i> note. Release the button when there, and a
               			 reference to <i>Witting 1978</i> will appear: 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/introRE-9.png"></p>
            </li>
            <li><i>My Readings</i> now contains a link to the first reading. The
               			 reference object Pliny creates as a result of the drag and drop is perhaps a
               			 little large (especially after we have entered here many items for the many
               			 things we have read), we could either use the minimize button on the new
               			 reference, or actually change the size by selecting the reference and dragging
               			 on its size handles to shrink it to a more manageable size.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>In summary,then, we here used on option on the Resource Explorer's
         		  <i>New Note</i> wizard to add a newly created note called "My Readings" as a
         		  bookmark, and we have stored a reference to the first item we have read on this
         		  <i>My Reading</i>s note. In the future, then, as we do more readings, we can
         		  add references to their Pliny items to <i>My Readings</i>, and then use the
         		  <i>My Readings</i> note as a way to manage the materials we have been reading.
         		  Furthermore, we have added <i>My Readings</i> as our first bookmark, so that we
         		  can jump readily to the <i>My Readings</i> item anytime we like.
      </p>
      <p>A final note about <i>My Bookmarks</i> items: although we used a
         		  wizard option when creating the <i>My Readings</i> note so that Pliny added the
         		  note immediately to the bookmarks list at the same time that it created it,
         		  there are also options on the Resource Explorer's contextual menu to add
         		  selected resources to the bookmark collection, and to remove items that are
         		  already there from the bookmark list.
      </p>
      <h2>Wrap Up</h2>
      <p>We have now created a note describing an article we have read. We
         		  recorded in Pliny notes that resulted from our reading of this article using
         		  the <i>referent</i> paradigm provided by Pliny, and we noted that when the
         		  referent mechansim is used Pliny puts links in the form of <i>reference
            		  objects</i> in the <i>reference area</i> between the referent and the notes
         		  subsequently created. We used the tools in Pliny to organise the note
         		  references in the article-note so that they were grouped by topics we were
         		  interested in. We examined now notes are organised in the <i>Resource
            		  Explorer</i> and noted that although we can use the Explorer to locate all the
         		  notes we created, it stores them alphabetically by name and this usually does
         		  not represent a conceptual organisation of our notes. Finally, we created a new
         		  note entitled <i>My Readings</i> and added it as a <i>Bookmark</i> item in the
         		  Resource Manager so that it could act as an entry point into our note
         		  collection. Finally, we used drag and drop between the Resource Manager and the
         		  annotation area in the <i>My Readings</i> note to add a reference to the
         		  article we read to this note.
      </p>
      <p>This marks the end of this tutorial. Our next tutorial, entitled
         		  <a href="tut.plinyWithWeb.html">Using Pliny with Images</a> will introduce you
         		  to Pliny's image annotation tool and how you will use it. If you have not
         		  already done so, however, this might be a good time to review the material in
         		  the section <a href="getting.started.html">Getting started with Pliny</a> which
         		  gives you an overview of the areas of the Pliny screen (toolbars and panes in
         		  particular) and how Pliny manages this area.
