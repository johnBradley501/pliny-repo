      <h1><a name="d1e509">1.1.3 Managing Panes</a></h1>
      <p>Eclipse and Pliny use the limited amount of screen space available on a
         		modern computer display by dividing the available screen area into panes, and
         		then layering different screen materials into them. Recall the sample Pliny
         		screen shown above:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/screen1.gif"></p>
      <p>As already mentioned in the section <a href="intro.uiBasics.html">Eclipse
            		UI Basics</a>, we see in this example two panes -- a small one to the left of
         		the screen, and a larger area to the right. As the <i>basics</i> section says,
         		the boundary between panes is moveable so that one can change the proportion of
         		the screeen given to each part. Furthermore, later in this section we will
         		describe how one can move a pane from the left side of the screen to the right,
         		or to the bottom, etc. For now, note that this pane layout provides a basic
         		navigational display (called the <i>Resource Explorer View</i> in Pliny) in the
         		small left pane, and reserves the larger pane to the right for resources of
         		various kinds that Pliny manages for you.
      </p>
      <h2>Tabs</h2>
      <p>Each pane can contain more than one display object. If it does the
         		  separate displays are usually stacked one on top of the other, so that only the
         		  top one is visible on the screen at a time. Which displays are open in a pane
         		  can be seen by the <i>tabs</i> that identifies them. The tabs show at the top
         		  of the pane, and in the main pane area in the figure above look like this.
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/tabs-1.gif"></p>
      <p>From the tabs display we can see that this pane currently displays
         		  three open displays: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>one called "Vico Frontispiece",</li>
            <li>a second called "Simweb: Dimension 1 outliers" and</li>
            <li>a third called "Simweb sample imge".</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>One displays with a white background -- it is the tab for the
         		  currently visible resource. The other two with gray backgrounds identify other
         		  resources that are also open in this pane but are not currently visible. To
         		  make one of them visible simply click in the appropriate tab.
      </p>
      <p>Tabs take up horizontal space, of course. What happens when there are
         		  more open resources in a pane than the pane's width can properly accomodate?
         		  You can see what Eclipse/Pliny does to the tabs from this example:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/tabs-2.gif"></p>
      <p>Here 6 items are open in the main pane. For the first four, Eclipse is
         		  showing you the names of each resource in the four tabs (although you can see
         		  that it has abbreviated the name of the second one -- if you place the pointer
         		  over this name Eclipse will show you the full name as a tooltip). The double
         		  chevron symbol following the 4th tab (<img align="middle" src="images/tabs-2a.gif">)
         		  show you that there are two more resources open here, but no room to show them
         		  in the list of tabs.
      </p>
      <p>Clicking on the double chevron object near the right end of the tab
         		  bar causes Eclipse to show you the open items in this pane as a list:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/tabs-3.gif"></p>
      <p>The list contains one item for each open display. The names in bold
         		  are the resources which do not have tabs at present, the names in non-bold font
         		  simply duplicate the tab list. To bring one of these items into view simply
         		  choose the item from the list and click on it.
      </p>
      <h2>Closing items</h2>
      <p>As you open more items in Pliny they accumulate in the editing pane.
         		  To remove an item from the editing pane you must close it. You can do this by
         		  clicking in the X icon that appears at the right end of its tab. Furthermore,
         		  if you point at the tab area on the screen and click with the right
         		  mouse-button you will be presented with a set of closing options: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>Close</b>: closes the top item
            </li>
            <li><b>Close others</b>: closes all the items <i>except</i> the top
               			 item
            </li>
            <li><b>Close all</b>: closes all the items including the top one,
               			 leaving the pane empty.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Note that items continue to accumulate as you open them. If you make
         		  no effort to close items shown in the tab area you could perhaps get hundreds
         		  of open items, and this can become unmanageable for you and will slow Pliny
         		  down. Therefore, remember to clean up the tab area by closing all the currently
         		  open items from time to time.
      </p>
      <h2>Arranging Panes on the Screen</h2>
      <p>When you start Pliny for the first time you will see that Pliny lays
         		  out a narrow navigation pane to the left containing the <i>Resource
            		  Explorer</i> view, and a wider main working pane (Eclipse's <i>editor pane</i>)
         		  to the right. You can rearrange content in the panes in a number of ways:
      </p>
      <h3>Moving the boundary</h3>
      <p>There are many situations in Pliny where the screen is divided into
         			 separate components -- Pliny's panes are one example. In Pliny some panes are
         			 further subdivided into areas. In almost all cases the border between any two
         			 of these pieces can be moved by you. To do so place the mouse pointer in the
         			 strip that separates the two panes. The mouse pointer should change to
         			 "<img align="middle" src="images/horiz-resize-pointer.jpg">" if the border area is vertical, and to
         			 an up-down pointing arrow if the border is horizontal. You can now, by holding
         			 down the main mouse button, drag the boundary to the right or the left (or
         			 up/down if the border is horizontal).
      </p>
      <h3>Dividing a Pane: docking</h3>
      <p>A pane can be divided into two or more parts so that more than one
         			 object can be seen at the same time. In Eclipse-speak this process is called
         			 <i>docking</i>. Suppose, for example, that you wish to divide the editor pane
         			 in two vertical pieces so that you can see two resources and their associated
         			 note references or annotations at the same time. To do this, place the mouse
         			 pointer in the tab of any of the open items and push the mouse button, dragging
         			 down towards the bottom of the pane area. White virtual dividing lines will
         			 appear to show where the dividing point is going to be, and the screen pointer
         			 <i>might</i> change to the icon <img align="middle" src="images/drop_stack.gif">. To
         			 indicate that you wish to split the screen top-bottom, drag the pointer near to
         			 the bottom of the pane area. It <i>might</i> then change to the icon
         			 <img align="middle" src="images/dock-below.gif"> to indicate that the newly created
         			 area will dock there. At the same time an grey line will appear across the pane
         			 showing where the boundary will be placed between the top and bottom parts. To
         			 complete the docking, release the mouse button. The screen will change to:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/docking-1.gif"></p>
      <p>Focus on the editing pane -- the main working area to the right.
         			 Here you can now see that the editing pane has been split in two pieces
         			 vertically, and the selected item (<i>Vico Frontispiece</i>) has been moved to
         			 the bottom half. The top area shows one of the other items that remain there.
         			 Eclipse/Pliny will normally split the area more or less in half, but you can
         			 change the proportion by dragging the boundary between the areas up or
         			 down.
      </p>
      <p>Once you have two or more docking areas in the pane you can move
         			 objects between them by pointing at the tab of the object you want to move and
         			 dragging the tab to the <i>tab area</i> in the new area where you want it to
         			 appear. If the last item is dragged out of an area (such as what would happen
         			 if we currently dragged <i>Vico Frontispiece</i> back up to the top area, or if
         			 we closed the Frontispiece view), the empty area will disappear and in this
         			 case (because it was created below the original area) the original area that is
         			 currently showing above it will expand to take over the vacated space.
      </p>
      <h3>Moving viewpanes out of the Pliny main window</h3>
      <p>You can move any of the view panes (containing things like the
         			 Resource Explorer) out of the main Pliny window altogether. To do so, point at
         			 the tab of the object you wish to drag out and drag it out of Pliny's main
         			 window. The object will then be displayed in a separate window, and the other
         			 panes in Pliny's main window will expand to take up the space that has been
         			 freed. Unfortunately, this cannot be done with the editor pane.
      </p>
      <p>To put a pane back into the main Pliny window <b>drag the tab</b> in
         			 the separate pane window (<b>not the window border</b>!) back to the main Pliny
         			 window and release.
      </p>
      <h2>The Minimize and Maximize buttons</h2>
      <p>In the top right corner of all panes are the <b>minimize</b>
         		  (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/closeNote.gif">) and <b>maximize</b> (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/openNote.gif">) buttons. 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>To reduce a pane to its smallest area click on the
               				<b>minimize</b> button. When you do this the minimize button will change to a
               				"multi-pane" button which you can click on to bring the pane back to its normal
               				size.
            </li>
            <li>To expand a pane so that it takes over the entire Eclipse screen
               				click on the <b>maximize</b> button. This will hide all other panes on the
               				screen so that the chosen panel has the largest possible area in which to
               				appear. To reduce it back to its normal size and place again click on the
               				"multi-pane" icon (<img align="middle" src="images/multiPaneIcon.gif">) which will then
               				be showing.
            </li>
         </ul>
