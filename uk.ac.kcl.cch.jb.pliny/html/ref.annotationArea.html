      <h1><a name="d1e5425">2.2.1 Annotation/Reference Area</a></h1>
      <p>Attaching references to notes, and the creation of annotations is a key
         		elements of Pliny, so it is not surprising that many Pliny components have an
         		area that is called the <i>Annotation Area</i> or the <i>Reference Area</i>.
         		The two kinds of area are very similar -- the most important difference is that
         		in the annotation area one gets to connect notes (or other types of resources)
         		to specific parts of the resource one is working with by linking it to an
         		anchor, whereas with the reference area one can only associate it with the
         		entire resource by creating a note in a reference area attached to the
         		resource.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, reference and annotation areas are almost the same. With the
         		annotation area one is able to create anchors to attach a note to a specific
         		part of the resource, with the reference area one cannot to this and no anchor
         		tool is provided. In general, when a facility described here applies to both
         		the reference and annotation area it will be mentioned without pointing this
         		out. Some facilities apply only to the annotation area, and they will be
         		labelled as such.
      </p>
      <h2>Parts of the Annotation/Reference Area</h2>
      <p>Three kinds of objects can appear in the annotation/reference area: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>Resource Reference Objects</b>: are objects that refer to other
               			 resources that Pliny manages. The commonest kind of reference is to a note --
               			 but you can create references to other Pliny resources as well. See discussion
               			 about reference objects in the section <a href="ref.referenceObject.html">Reference Object</a>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Anchors</b>: are rectangles that highlight an area on an image
               			 or PDF page. They only can be drawn on annotation areas.
            </li>
            <li><b>Connections</b>: are arrows that can be drawn to indicate a
               			 connection between reference objects or anchors. <i>Note</i>: early versions of
               			 Pliny showed no arrowheads to provide the connection line with a direction --
               			 but this has been changed with version 0.8.4.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You can see them illustrated and labelled (with orange labelling)
         		  below:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-1.gif"></p>
      <p>There are 4 <i>reference objects</i> here. 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>Two of the reference objects are coloured green, and one is blue
               			 and one is orange. The colours come from the reference object's <i>type</i>:
               			 all reference objects have a <i>type</i> associated with them, and colours for
               			 display purposes are associated with the type. Thus, the colour tells you what
               			 "type" of reference it is.
            </li>
            <li>Three of the reference objects are expanded so that we can see
               			 their contents. One of them is minimized and only its title area is showing.
               			 There is more information about reference objects in the section
               			 <a href="ref.referenceObject.html">Reference Object</a>. 
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p> There are two <i>connections</i> shown, one between a reference
         		  object and an anchor, and another between two reference objects. Connections
         		  can also be typed, and, like the reference objects, the colour indicates what
         		  type has been associated. Finally, there is one anchor object, which can also
         		  be typed.
      </p>
      <p>About types: see further discussion about types and their significance
         		  in the reference section to the <a href="ref.typeManagerView.html">Type
            		  Manager</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Creation of Objects</h2>
      <p>Objects are created in the annotation/reference in one of two ways: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>Creation Buttons</b>: By clicking on the appropriate button on
               			 the toolbar. For the case of notes, this creates not only a new reference area,
               			 but a new note that it refers to as well.
            </li>
            <li><b>Drag and Drop</b>: By dragging an reference object onto an
               			 annotation/reference area where it currently does not already exist.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Creation Buttons</h3>
      <p> Creation buttons are provided in the toolbar for the
         			 editor/annotator, and appears above the editor area in the Eclipse toolbar
         			 area. You click on one of the buttons to indicate that you want to create a new
         			 object of the kind indicated by the button, and then you drag an area in the
         			 annotation/reference area to define the place where one wishes to create the
         			 object and its size. Creation tools that appear in several tool bars are: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>Note Creation Tool</b>:
               				<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">: click on this item to create a
               				new note and a reference to the note. Keyboard shortcut: F5
            </li>
            <li><b>Connection Creation Tool</b>:
               				<img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">: click on this item to
               				create a new connection. After choosing the tool one can indicate what is to
               				connect by pointing the mouse at the source end of the connection, holding down
               				the mouse button and dragging to the target end of the connection. When the
               				mouse button is released the connection will be made. Keyboard shortcut:
               				F6
            </li>
            <li><b>Annotation Creation Tool</b>:
               				<img align="middle" src="images/icons/annotationIcon.gif">: click on this tool (not
               				available in the Note Editor or the Web Browser since anchors cannot be created
               				there) as a short-cut way to create a new anchor, note and connection between
               				them. You will draw out the area where the anchor is to sit, and Pliny will
               				place the note and link for you, but you are free to then move the placement of
               				the note if you wish. Keyboard shortcut: F7
            </li>
            <li><b>Anchor Creation Tool</b>:
               				<img align="middle" src="images/icons/anchorIcon.gif">: click on this item to create a
               				new anchor. This tool is not avialable for reference areas because no anchors
               				can be created on them. Keyboard shortcut F8.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
      <p>Drag and Drop in Pliny always copies an object rather than moves it.
         			 When the drag finishes in the reference/annotation area it is used to create
         			 reference objects for the object that was dragged in. There are 4 different
         			 possible sources for a drag and drop into a reference/annotation area:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-2.gif"></p>
      <p>Describing the sources from left to right: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>One may drag a resource item from the Resource Explorer onto the
               				annotation/reference area. The result is that Pliny creates a new reference to
               				the selected resource and places it in the area where the drag ended.
            </li>
            <li>One may drag text from a drag-and-drop-aware piece of software
               				(here, shown as Microsoft Word, but other aware software will also support
               				this). This will cause Pliny to take the selected text and use it to create a
               				new note, and then create a reference to that note in the area where the drag
               				ended. Note that in this case, because the selected text included text that
               				appears to be a title, Pliny will take the title and use it as the name of the
               				note it creates.
            </li>
            <li>If you have two editors/annotators open at the same time you can
               				drag from the drag source for the resource into the other resource. Here, the
               				drag source is linked to the note "Wittig 1978" and as a result Pliny would
               				create a new reference to "Wittig 1978" and place it in the destination
               				annotation area.
            </li>
            <li>If you have two editors/annotators open at the same time you can
               				also drag from the drag source for one of the reference objects in the other
               				resource. Here, the drag source linked to the reference to "Wittig 1978: CBLA
               				and New Criticism" has been dragged -- thus a reference to this note will be
               				placed in the new area. If using drag and drop between two different editors
               				(as shown above) be sure that you drag the <i>icon</i> specifically. If you
               				start your drag from other parts of the object's title area you will be asking
               				Pliny to move the object in the current reference area, not drag it to a new
               				one. Drag and drop between reference areas <i>only</i> works when the icon is
               				specifically dragged about.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>A drag can be cancelled before it is finished (after the mouse
         			 button has been depressed, but before it is released) by pushing the
         			 <tt>Esc</tt> key.
      </p>
      <h2>Selecting objects</h2>
      <p>Editing of objects is dependant upon the object first being selected.
         		  Pliny shows a selected anchor or reference by putting its "selection handles"
         		  around it. Here is a picture of a selected reference:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-3.gif"></p>
      <p>The selection shows up as a heavier black border with little boxes, or
         		  handles, placed within it.
      </p>
      <p>It shows a selected connection by putting a selection handle at each
         		  end of the connection:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-4.gif"></p>
      <h3>Ways to select objects</h3>
      <p>A reference, anchor or connection is selected by pointing at it with
         			 the mouse pointer (in the case of a reference, one points to the reference head
         			 area) and clicking once on the mouse.
      </p>
      <p>More than one item may be selected at a time. There are two ways to
         			 achieve this: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><i>Adding to the selection</i>: If one holds down the shift key
               				while selecting an object the new item is added to the previous selection (or
               				removed from the previous selection if already selected).
            </li>
            <li><i>Drag selection</i>: One can drag over an area to select all
               				objects contained within it. The drag-select operation must not begin over any
               				displayed object.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Editing of Objects</h2>
      <p>Once one has selected objects of interest there are various things one
         		  can do with them: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>Deleting</b>: You can delete selected references, anchors or
               			 connections by pushing the delete key or by choosing Delete from the Edit
               			 menu.
            </li>
            <li><b>Resizing references/anchors</b>: You can resize anchors or
               			 references by dragging on a selection handle.
            </li>
            <li><b>Moving references/anchors:</b> You can reposition anchors or
               			 reference by pointing in the title area or a reference or anywhere on the
               			 perimeter of an anchor and dragging.
            </li>
            <li><b>Operations on the content of a reference</b>: See the reference
               			 object section for information about the kind of things you can do to a
               			 reference object.
            </li>
            <li><b>Cut/Copy</b>: You can cut/copy references and anchors from one
               			 place and paste them in elsewhere using the usual cut/copy/paste methods.
            </li>
            <li><b>Minimize</b>: You can minimize a set of selected reference
               			 objects by clicking on the "Minimize all" button from the toolbar (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/allClose.gif">) or choosing "Minimize Selected" from the
               			 contextual menu.
            </li>
            <li><b>Moving connections</b>: You can change either end of a
               			 connection so that it points to a different reference/anchor object. To do this
               			 drag the relevent end of the connection to the new object.
            </li>
            <li><b>Contextual Menu</b>: The contextual menu operations apply to
               			 selected objects. See the next section for information about the Contextual
               			 Menu.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Context Menu Commands</h2>
      <p>Pliny's reference/annotation area have what Eclipse calls a "context
         		  menu" available. To see it select one or more object and while they are
         		  selected click on the other mouse button (or, on the one-button Macintosh,
         		  click while depressing the Ctrl button). The contextual menu will appear:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-5.gif"></p>
      <p>In this figure only the commands available from Pliny for reference
         		  objects are showing, but it is possible that other commands contributed by
         		  other Eclipse plugins might also appear in your list, depending upon what
         		  objects you have selected.
      </p>
      <p>You can choose one of the operations from the menu by moving the mouse
         		  to choose the item and pushing the mouse button. The chosen operation will be
         		  applied to all items selected at the time for which they are suitable. The
         		  operations from the context menu are: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>Minimize selected</b>: applies to selected references only, but
               			 minimises all of them -- so that they appear with only they title area
               			 showing.
            </li>
            <li><b>Maximise selected</b>: applies to selected references only, but
               			 expands all of them -- so that they show both their title area and content or
               			 map area. The size after expansion is the size they were before they were
               			 minimised.
            </li>
            <li><b>Open selected</b>: applies to selected references only, and
               			 opens the selected objects so that each gets its own editor object -- the Note
               			 Editor, Web Browser, Image Annotator or PDF Annotator -- as appropriate.
               			 Alternatively, an associated object can be opened simply by double-clicking on
               			 its icon that appears at the top left corner of the reference object (see more
               			 about this below).
            </li>
            <li><b>Reverse link direction</b>: only appears when connections are
               			 among the selected items, and causes the direction of the selected links to be
               			 reversed.
            </li>
            <li><b>Change type to current</b>: changes the type associated with
               			 selected objects to the "current type". See the section on <i>types</i> for
               			 more details.
            </li>
            <li><b>Set type to</b>: if chosen the list of defined types appears,
               			 and you can choose one from the list. All the selected objects have their type
               			 changed to the selected one.
            </li>
            <li><b>Group Objects</b>: This object is only available when more than
               			 one reference is selected. It creates a new note and first takes the selected
               			 objects and moves them into the new note's reference area. It then displays a
               			 reference to the new note in the original reference area. The visual effect is
               			 that the selected objects get put into a new group object. You can see the
               			 effect from these "before/after" views (where originally two note references
               			 were selected of the three shown): 
               			 
               <center><br><br><table border="0">
                     <tr>
                        <th>Before</th>
                        <th>After</th>
                     </tr>
                     <tr>
                        <td>
                           <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-6.gif"></p>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                           <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-7.gif"></p>
                        </td>
                     </tr>
                  </table><br><br></center> 
               			 
               <p>The two selected objects have been put in a new group object which
                  				is roughly the size of the area the selected objects occupied before. The one
                  				unselected object (here "Rockwell 2005") remains outside the group.
               </p> 
               			 
               <p>There are several things to note here: 
                  			 
                  <ul>
                     <li>First, Pliny gives the group object it created an invented name
                        				  ("My Readings: New Group") that you are most likely to want to change to be
                        a
                        				  name that describes the group you have just formed. As for other names, double
                        				  click on it to type in a new name.
                     </li>
                     <li>The size of the reference object is calculated from the area
                        				  over which the selected objects where originally spread, with some further
                        				  minor adjustments in size. As is the case with any reference, its size can be

            <li><b>Change type to current</b>: A Reference object has a <i>type</i>
               			 associated with it which can be used to assert something about the role of the

               			 "current" type which will be used each time a new item is set up, and by
               			 default this current type will be the "default" (unspecified) type and usually
               			 coloured green. However, in the <a href="ref.typeManagerView.html">Type Manager
                  			 View</a> one can make any type you have the "current type". Use this command

      <h2>Managing types by dragging and dropping them from the Type
         		  Manager
      </h2>
      <p>Recall that a type of reference can be assigned to any reference
         		  object, and the contextual menu provides two ways to specify the type to be
         		  assigned to reference objects: <i>Change type to current</i>, and <i>Change
            		  type to...</i> (described in more detail immediately above this section of this
         		  document). However, there is a quicker way to manage types if the Type Manager
         		  view is open: it can be used as a kind of "type menu" to assign types to
         		  reference objects by means of dragging and dropping (DnD) them into your
         		  reference area. Making these changes by DnD is often quite efficient to do, and
         		  is usually faster than changing the types via the contextual menu commands.
      </p>
      <p>There are two kinds of results that can be produced by the dragging
         		  and dropping of types from the Type Manager: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>you can use drag and drop to <b>change a type of an existing
                  			 reference object</b> (or a link between reference objects):
               			 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-13.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>In the figure above, the <i>source document</i> type displayed in
                  				the Type Manager has been dragged to the header of the reference object for
                  				"Wittig 1978". By doing this one changes the type of the Wittig 1978 reference
                  				to <i>source document</i>, and thus changes its display colour to that
                  				associated with the <i>source document</i> type:
               </p>
               			 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-14.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>Please note that it is important that you drop the type onto the
                  				<i>reference header</i>, not the reference body. The point indicated by the
                  				arrow head during the dragging operation is what matters here.
               </p> 
               			 
               <p>Dragging a type from the Type manager can also be used to change a
                  				linking line, by dropping the type onto the line itself.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>you can use drag and drop to <b>create a new note of the specified
                  			 type</b>. To do this, drag the type to any point in the reference area which is
               			 <i>not</i> in a header for an existing reference object, or a link between
               			 objects:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-15.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>Here the user has dropped the <i>example of</i> type in on a spot
                  				in the reference area not already occupied by another reference object. As a
                  				result, Pliny will interpret this as a request to create a new note at the
                  				indicated spot, and set its reference object's type to the selected <i>example
                     				of</i> type:
               </p>
               <p align="center"><img src="images/refArea-16.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>The newly created note starts off with a reference which has been
                  				assigned the type <i>example of</i>, and, as a consequence, has the colours of
                  				the <i>example of</i> type.
               </p> 
               			 
               <p>Note that if you wish to create a note of a selected type, you
                  				<i>must</i> drag it to somewhere on the target reference area that is not
                  				already occupied by the header of an existing reference object -- otherwise,
                  				Pliny will interpret the drop as a request to <i>change</i> the type of the
                  				reference object, rather than the creation of a new item altogether.
