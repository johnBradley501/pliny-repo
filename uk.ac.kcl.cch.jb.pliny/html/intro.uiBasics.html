      <h1><a name="d1e126">1.1.1 Eclipse UI Basics</a></h1>
      <p><i>Pliny</i> can operate both as a standalone application, and as a
         		plugin to a fuller version of <i>Eclipse</i>. Much of the operation is the same
         		in both cases, but there are differences in aspects of the screen layout since
         		elements on the screen when <i>Pliny</i> is run within a full version of
         		Eclipse will have many non-Pliny elements supporting the other "non-Pliny"
         		things that other plugins in a full Eclipse allow you to do. In this section,
         		however, we will show the screen as it looks when <i>Pliny</i> is run
         		standalone. In many other examples within these documents, however, you may see
         		screen shots taken when <i>Pliny</i> is run within a full version of
         		Eclipse.
      </p>
      <p>The basic screen layout for <i>Pliny</i> as shown when run standalone on
         		a Windows machine (see topic later on this page about how it looks on the
         		Macintosh) is shown below:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/screen1.gif"></p>
      <p>Pliny operates as a part of Eclipse, and certain aspects of the screen
         		layout have to do with the way that Eclipse deals with the screen: 
         	 
         <ul>
            <li> 
               		  
               <p><b>Menu Bar</b>: The top area of the screen/Eclipse window contains
                  			 a conventional menu bar. On a Windows machine it looks like this:
               </p>
               		  
               <p align="center"><img src="images/menu-bar.gif"></p> 
               		  
               <p> (On the Macintosh, eclipse shows its menu bar at the very top of
                  			 the screen, as is normal for applications on the Macintosh). You use the menu
                  			 bar in the same way that you use it on other programs you are familiar with --
                  			 select an menu with the mouse and then select an item from the drop-down menu
                  			 that results. The menu here provides a relatively standard set of functions,
                  			 including, under the File menu, the <i>Exit</i> command which ends
                  			 <i>Pliny</i>.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Toolbar</b>: Directly below the menu area one sees a row of icons
               		  split, left and right, into two groups. This area near the top of Pliny's
               		  window is called in Eclipse-talk the "<i>Toolbar</i>". It looks like this:
               		  
               <p align="center"><img src="images/toolbar1.gif"></p> 
               		  
               <p>A tool bar provides a set of icons that, when clicked on, carry out
                  			 actions for you. There is more information about toolbars
                  			 <a href="intro.toolbars.html">here</a>.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Panes:</b> The large central area of the screen and directly below
               		  the toolbar is the principal display area of Eclipse and Pliny. In the screen
               		  above it is divided into two <i>panes</i> -- a relatively narrow one to the
               		  right, and the larger area to the left. In the figure above the narrow left
               		  panel contains Pliny's <i>Resource Explorer</i> view -- you can see Eclipse
               		  trying to show you this name as "Resource Explo..." in the <i>tab area</i>; the
               		  top left corner; of the view's panel. The larger left area is what Eclipse
               		  considers its <i>editor pane</i> and we can see there an image of the
               		  frontispiece of Vico's <i>New Science</i> with various annotations added to it.
               		  Often in computing one equates "editor" with "text editor", although as you can
               		  see here, Pliny's editors often provide facilities other than those needed
               		  simply to edit text. In general, the editor pane provides access to things that
               		  are in Pliny called <i>resources</i>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Editor Pane</b>: In Eclipse, and therefore in Pliny as well, the
               		  editor pane can hold more than one open resource. 
               		  
               <ul>
                  <li><b>Tabs</b>: At the top of the editor page is a set of tabs that
                     				identify what resources are currently open there. The tabs contain an icon that
                     				indicates the kind of resource it is, and its name. There are three tabs
                     				showing, so three Pliny resources are open, with names "Vico Frontispiece",
                     				"Simweb dimension 1 outliers" and "Simweb sample image: Intro". The tab in
                     				white belongs to the item currently displaying on the screen -- in this case
                     				the materials for the "Vico Frontispiece" resource. Note that the first
                     				resource tab shows an <img align="middle" src="images/icons/imageIcon.gif"> icon, and
                     				the following two tabs show a <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
                     				icon. This reflects that fact that the first tab is attached to the display of
                     				Image resources, and the other two tabs are for a Note resource. The
                     				significance of the kinds of resources will be explained later.
                  </li>
                  <li>You can <i>close</i> any of the open resources (removing it from
                     				the set of currently open resources) by clicking on the X showing in the tab to
                     				the right of the resource name "Vico Frontespiece".
                  </li>
                  <li>Knowing how to manage the contents of panes and how they are
                     				displayed on the screen is essential to the effective use of Eclipse in
                     				general, and Pliny in particular. The section <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing
                        				Panes</a> provides more detailed information about this.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Perspective</b>: In Eclipse a particular layout of panels is
               		  called in a <i>perspective</i>, and the name of the perspective we are seeing
               		  here is the <i>Pliny perspective</i>. If you are running Pliny not as a
               		  standalone program but instead within a mix of other applications within
               		  Eclipse you will probably find that Eclipse provides you with a number of
               		  different screen layouts -- each one designed for a specific type of task or
               		  application. In the standalone version only the Pliny perspective is available
               		  and there is no need to show you what perspective is active. However, in the
               		  full version of Eclipse the currently active perspective is named in the upper
               		  right corner of the screen.
            </li>
            <li>The border between the two panes can be moved by you. To do so place
               		  the mouse pointer in the strip that separates the two panes. The mouse pointer
               		  should change to "<img align="middle" src="images/horiz-resize-pointer.jpg">". You can now, by holding down the main
               		  mouse button, drag the boundary to the right or the left.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Views and Editors</h2>
      <p>Eclipse supports two kinds of displays that appear in panes:
         		  <i>views</i> and <i>editors</i>. Thus, each of Pliny's major user components is
         		  classified as either a view or an editor as well. Although the distinction
         		  between view and editor is often relevant for traditional Eclipse applications,
         		  it is less comfortable within Pliny itself. However, there are some differences
         		  between how views and editors behave that is useful to understand, and in this
         		  section we will describe the difference: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>Editors</b>: Eclipse is designed in such a way that for the user
               			 an editor is meant to be the centre of focus when work is being done. Eclipse
               			 will allow you to operate more than one annotator/editor at a time (perhaps
               			 each one open to different things), but they all must be displayed in Eclipse's
               			 editor pane, which usually takes up most of the screen. 
               			 
               <p>In the context of Pliny, the idea that the editors are the centre
                  				of focus for work is preserved. Pliny is a tool for creating and managing notes
                  				and annotation. It is this activity that is the centre of the user's attention
                  				when s/he is using Pliny. Thus, various tools that allow you to create and
                  				manage notes and annotations are all created as Eclipse editors. These are
                  				Pliny's <a href="ref.noteEditor.html">Note Editor</a>, the embedded
                  				<a href="ref.webBrowser.html">Web Browser</a>, and the
                  				<a href="ref.imageAnnotator.html">Image-</a> and <a href="ref.pdfAnnotator.html">PDF annotators</a>. Note that although these are all
                  				editors from Eclipse's perspective, only the Note Editor actually has the word
                  				"editor" in its name.
               </p> 
               			 
               <p>Furthermore, although all editors must share a single pane,
                  				several instances of any particular editor may be open at the same time, and
                  				each instance is distinguished by its Tab. Thus, if 3 different notes and 2
                  				images are open at a point in a Pliny session, all of them must appear in the
                  				editor pane. If there is horizontal space to show them all, five tabs will
                  				appear at the top of the editor pane, three of them referring to the three
                  				Pliny notes and two to two Pliny-managed images.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Views</b>: In Eclipse a view supports the central work that goes
               			 on in the Editor with various kinds of supplementary services. Views may be
               			 spread between one or more panes (never in the editor pane), and usually the
               			 view panes are arranged around the central editor pane. Pliny's views are the
               			 the <a href="ref.resourceExplorer.html">Resource Explorer</a>,
               			 <a href="ref.containmentView.html">Containment View</a>,
               			 <a href="ref.resourceHolderView.html">Resource Holder View</a>,
               			 <a href="ref.noteSearchView.html">Note Search View</a>,
               			 <a href="ref.typeManagerView.html">Type Manager View</a> and the
               			 <a href="ref.annotationView.html">Annotation View</a>. 
               			 
               <p>Although views may be spread between several panes, only one
                  				instance of any particular Pliny view may be open at a time -- there cannot be
                  				two instances of the <i>Resource Explorer</i> available at one time, for
                  				example.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Eclipse normally defines a particular relationship between an editor
         		  or view and the pane in which it appears on the screen, and this rule derives
         		  from the uniqueness of the editor pane: All editors must share the editor pane,
         		  and there may only be one editor pane, whereas a set of views may be
         		  distributed between a number of separate panes. Thus, it is important to
         		  remember that although separate editors must be stacked into a single pane --
         		  the editor pane -- and the views may also be stacked into a single pane (or
         		  more than one), an editor and a view cannot share a single pane -- all the
         		  editors must appear in the single editor pane, and the views must appear in one
         		  or more view panes.
      </p>
      <p>The following illustration (which shows Pliny at a point where several
         		  editors and views are open at the same time) illustrates some aspects of the
         		  relationships between panes and editors/view. The panes have been identified
         		  within the illustration by surrounding them with orange borders, and attaching
         		  an orange label to them. Of course, these orange labels and boxes would not be
         		  displayed by Pliny itself:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/views-editors.gif"></p>
      <p>Points to observe about this figure: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>First, although the Pliny window will always have an Editor Pane,
               			 it needn't always have any View Panes. The Editor Pane will take up whatever
               			 space is not occupied by the View Panes. Here we see three View Panes, however
               			 when you start up Pliny for the first time you will at first see only one View
               			 Pane (to the left of the Editor Pane area), and even this can be closed and
               			 removed from the screen if you wish. The section <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes</a> tells you how to get more than one View
               			 Pane operating if you wish.
            </li>
            <li><b>Editor Pane</b>: Note first the editor pane (which is shown here
               			 as surrounded on three sides by view panes) contains three open editors -- you
               			 can see their three tabs at the top of the editor pane. The editor pane has
               			 open editors for <i>Vico Frontispiece</i>, <i>Sibweb dimension...</i> and
               			 <i>Simweb sample i...</i>. At the time this screen image was taken <i>Vico
                  			 Frontispiece</i> was currently at the front of the stack of open editors, so
               			 only its display is visible in the editor pane.
            </li>
            <li><b>View Panes</b>: Surrounding the editor pane on three sides are
               			 three view panes. The top left view pane is displaying the <i>Resource
                  			 Explorer</i> view, the top right pane displays the <i>Type Manager</i> view,
               			 and the bottom pane displays the <i>Containment</i> view. You can see their
               			 names in the tabs area showing at the top of each view Pane area. We will see
               			 in the section <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes</a> that the spatial
               			 relationship between the view panes and the editor pane can be altered by
               			 dragging and dropping them -- indeed, two views can share the same pane, but
               			 when the screen looks like it does above one cannot open more than the one
               			 instance of, say, the <i>Resource Explorer</i> since at this time it is already
               			 displaying.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Now that you have seen the main layout of the screen and been
         		  introduced to editors and views, go to the <a href="intro.toolbars.html">Toolbar</a> section to read more about the toolbars, or
         		  the <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes</a> section to find out more about
         		  how to manage Pliny panes.
