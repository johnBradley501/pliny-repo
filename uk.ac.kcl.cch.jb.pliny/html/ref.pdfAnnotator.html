      <h1><a name="d1e3877">2.1.3 PDF Annotator</a></h1>
      <p>This section provides a reference section for the Pliny's PDF/Acrobat
         		annotator. If you are unfamiliar with how to use the PDF annotator within
         		Pliny, you might wish to see <a href="tut.pdfAnnotator.html">the tutorial on this
            		subject</a>. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Note</b>: Pliny's annotation tool for PDF files is built on top of
         		the open source version of the PDF viewer from <a href="http://www.jpedal.org">JPedal</a>. We have also been granted permission
         		to include the pjes.jar library which allows the annotator to work with PDF's
         		embedded fonts. Many thanks to IDRsolutions who have made an open-source
         		version of their viewer available, and allowed us to include the pjes.jar
         		library. 
      </p>
      <h2>What's it for</h2>
      <p>The PDF Annotator can be used whenever you wish to annotate pages in a
         		  PDF/Acrobat file. It will launch in the large central "working are" in the
         		  Pliny window.
      </p>
      <h2>Importing a PDF file</h2>
      <p>A PDF file must be imported into the Pliny system before it can be
         		  annotated. The importing process does two things: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>It caches a copy of the PDF file in Pliny's own storage area. Pliny
               			 always uses the copy of the file in its cache whenever it shows it to you.
            </li>
            <li>It creates an PDF resource which is Pliny's way of addressing the
               			 PDF file itself. 
            </li>
         </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>You import the file by dragging a reference to it, or from a browser
         		  displaying it and dropping it on the PDF/Acrobat folder in the Resource
         		  Explorer
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-ref1.png"></p>
      <p>Whether the source is a personal copy of a PDF file, or one you've
         		  found over the web it is important to realise that it is always cached, and
         		  then opened. There is a lot to do inside Pliny to start up the PDF annotator
         		  before it can appear, please be patient if this takes a moment or two before
         		  the first page itself appears.
      </p>
      <h3>What to drag?</h3>
      <p>If you are planning to import a PDF file you have on your hard disk,
         			 find the icons that represent the files on your machine and drag them to the
         			 <i>PDF/Acrobat</i> folder in the Resource Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>If you find the PDF file using your non-Pliny browser such as
         			 Internet Explorer or FireFox, take the icon beside the URL in the browser's
         			 location area and drag it to the <i>PDF/Acrobat</i> folder.
      </p>
      <p>If you find the PDF file while using the embedded Pliny browser take
         			 the browser's drag source object and drag it to the <i>PDF/Acrobat</i>
         			 folder.
      </p>
      <p>This is shown in the following figure:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-tut-1.png"></p>
      <h2>Screen components</h2>
      <p>Here is a typical display of the PDF file Annotator, with its parts
         		  labelled: 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-ref2.png"></p>
      <p>The PDF file annotator has the following sections: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>The main working area is the <i>Annotation Area</i>. Here the a PDF
               			 page appears, and the annotations attached to it can be created and edited. It
               			 works in a way that is very similar to the Image annotators annotation area:
               			 the annotation and note materials appear combined with the image of the page
               			 they belong to. There is more about the Annotation Area and how to work in it
               			 in <a href="ref.annotationArea.html">its description</a>. 
            </li>
            <li>Above the annotation area is a collection of tools and other
               			 objects. First, near the top is a a tab, and it identifies the PDF file you are
               			 working on. The name showing there comes from the name of the PDF resource and
               			 is not necessarily the URL where the PDF file came from.
            </li>
            <li>The PDF annotator has two groups of tools. The <b>Navigation
                  			 Toolbar</b> allows you to move between pages, change the size of the page
               			 image, etc. The <b>Annotation Toolbar</b>, which is in the Pliny toolbar area
               			 and allows to you create and manage annotations and notes on PDF pages. See the
               			 next two sections for discussions about the two toolbars.
            </li>
            <li>Also in the Pliny toolbar one finds the drag and drop object, which
               			 is described below, and the Resource name field which allows you to change the
               			 name of the Pliny resource object for this PDF file. This name is the one Pliny
               			 uses everywhere to identify this particular resource.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Navigation ToolBar</h2>
      <p>The Navigation ToolBar, with its button's labelled, looks like
         		  this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-ref3.gif"></p>
      <p>Most of the functions of the buttons and display and how they work
         		  should be obvious. However, two perhaps are not: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>Select Page</b>: Use this to jump to a particular page. To
               			 operate it <i>do not</i> click on the icon, but on the down arrow <i>beside</i>
               			 it. A menu will then appear with one item for each page in the document. The
               			 item will also show in bracekts how many reference objects appear on the page.
               			 An entry such as "p 3 [4]" refers to page 3, which contains four reference
               			 objects. Select the page you want to jump to. Note that the page numbering is
               			 based on the count of <i>the number of pages</i>, not necessarily the page
               			 numbering at actually <i>appears</i> on the pages themselves: the first page
               			 might be numbered "i" on the page, and the page numbered "1" on the page could
               			 be in fact the 5th page of the document.
            </li>
            <li><b>Open Outline</b>: some PDF files have a table of contents
               			 included which, if present, allows you to jump to the page containing the
               			 beginning of a chapter, section, etc by clicking on its name. To see the
               			 outline for your current PDF file -- if there is one -- click on this button.
               			 The outline display uses Eclipse's outline view.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Annotation Toolbar</h2>
      <p>The toolbar for the PDF file Annotator (which Eclipse places in the
         		  main toolbar area) contains tools that work with the Annotator. Most of them
         		  are used with the Annotation Area and allow things to be done within it. The
         		  toolbar for the PDF Annotator looks like this: 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-ref4.png"></p>
      <ul>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/referencersOn.gif">: Use this icon by
            			 clicking on the down arrow symbol (<img align="middle" src="images/pull-down.gif">) to
            			 its right rather than the icon itself. Clicking the down-arrow will cause Pliny
            			 to generate a list of all resources managed by Pliny that refer to the current
            			 image. To open one of these resources, choose it from the list.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/undo.gif">: This icon allows you to
            			 undo the previous action you have done in the Annotation area. Undo can also be
            			 chosen from the "Edit" menu, or requested using the standard keystroke for your
            			 platform.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/redo.gif">: This icon allows you to
            			 redo an action you have just undone in the Annotation area. Redo is also
            			 available from the "Edit" menu, or can be requested by the standard keystroke
            			 for redo.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">: This icon allows you
            			 to create a new note and a note reference for it that will appear in the
            			 Annotation area. You can use it in two ways: 
            			 
            <ol>
               <li>first click on the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
                  				  button, then in the annotation area drag over the area there that you wish to
                  				  be used for the space the reference is to occupy, or
               </li>
               <li>you can drag the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
                  				  button itself into the annotation area. This will give you a "standard size"
                  				  note which you can later change its size.
               </li>
            </ol> After Pliny has responded and created a reference and new note
            			 for you, you will want to type in the note name and its text in the newly
            			 created space. Each time a new note is created the "create new note" state is
            			 cleared, and you must push the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
            			 again to create another note or drag a new note from the
            			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> button. There is a keyboard
            			 shortcut that puts Pliny in "create new note" state as well: F5).
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">: This icon
            			 allows you to create a connection between two objects that appear in the
            			 annotation area (a line joining them). A connection is usually used to
            			 represent some sort of conceptual connection between the two items.. To
            			 establish a connection line first click on the
            			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">, then click in the reference
            			 or anchor that should hold the start of the line, and drag to the reference or
            			 anchor where the line should end. Each time you wish to create a new connection
            			 you must first push the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">
            			 again. The keyboard shortcut for this is F6.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/annotationIcon.gif">: This icon
            			 creates a full annotation for you. An annotation consists of a note, a
            			 reference to the note (on this image), an anchor the note refers to and a
            			 connection line between them. To use it, first click on the
            			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/annotationIcon.gif"> button, then drag over the
            			 area over the image where you wish the anchor to be placed. Pliny will respoind
            			 by creating the anchor, a note and note reference and a linking line. You can
            			 then type in the note title and text in the newly created reference and can
            			 move the note to another place on the screen if you wish. Each time a new
            			 annotation is created the "create new annotation" state is cleared, and you
            			 must push the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/annotationIcon.gif"> again to
            			 create another annotation. The annotation button is a convenience only -- using
            			 it is exactly equivalent to using the anchor button (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/anchorIcon.gif">) to create the anchor, the note button
            			 (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">) and the connection button
            			 (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">) to join them together. The
            			 keyboard shortcut for this is F7.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/anchorIcon.gif">: This icon creates
            			 an anchor area for you. To use it first click on the
            			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/anchorIcon.gif"> as a button, then in the
            			 annotation area drag out the area where you wish the anchor to appear. Pliny
            			 will respond by creating the anchor for you. Each time a new anchor is created
            			 the "create new anchor" state is cleared and you must push the
            			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/anchorIcon.gif"> again to create another anchor.
            			 The keyboard shortcut for this is F8.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/allClose.gif">: Click on this icon to
            			 cause all the references in this reference area to be minimized.
         </li>
         <li></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
      <p>An important element of Pliny's design was in the work involved in
         		  trying to make the creation of notes and annotations as straight-forward as
         		  possible. To this end we have added various drag and drop features to Pliny. Of
         		  course, references or anchors can be dragged about on a PDF page's annotation
         		  area -- that is how you make use of the 2D space the annotation area provided
         		  to organise the notes. However, drag and drop can also be used to copy
         		  materials from outside the image annotator into it, or from inside the image
         		  annotator to other areas. Here is a summary of these drag and drop features
         		  available in the annotator:
      </p>
      <h3><i>Into</i> the Annotator
      </h3>
      <p>Here are the kind of things that can be dragged from elsewhere into
         			 the annotation area: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>A reference to any resource can be dragged from the Resource
               				Explorer to the 2D annotation area. Pliny will interpret this as a request to
               				create a reference to that resource there. A reference to a note in the Note
               				Search View works the same way.
            </li>
            <li>If you have more than one editor/annotator open at the same time
               				you can drag a reference from one into the other by dragging the reference's
               				<i>drag source object</i>. See the figure in the section <i>Out of the
                  				Annotator</i> to see where the drag source objects are.
            </li>
            <li>Text can be selected from another program that supports Drag and
               				Drop (such as Word) outside of Pliny and dragged onto the annotation area.
               				Pliny will interpret this as a request to create a note and a reference to it
               				in the area. If the dragged text begins with a short line of text that looks
               				like a heading, Pliny will interpret this as the note's title.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3><i>Out of </i>the annotator
      </h3>
      <p>The PDF file annotator provides two kinds of drag source objects
         			 that can be dragged from the annotator into another Pliny object. The following
         			 figure shows them:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-ref5.png"></p>
      <p>Here we see Pliny showing two working areas (the help section
         			 "Dividing a Pane: docking" in the topic <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing
            			 Panes</a> describes how to split the Pliny window in this way). In the bottom
         			 area the PDF annotator is displaying the 2nd page of our "Rockwell 2005"
         			 document, and in the top area a note called "Computer Based Text Analysis". A
         			 Pliny user can use one of the two drag source objects shown to make a reference
         			 from something in the PDF annotator to a reference/annotation area in another.
         			 You can see the drags being represented by the curved line with arrow from the
         			 two source objects in the PDF area to the note's reference area. 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>If the user wanted to insert a reference to the PDF page itself
               				-- page 2 of "Rockwell 2005" -- in his/her "Computer Based Text Analysis" note,
               				s/he should point at the drag source object belonging to the "Rockwell 2005"
               				PDF file (of the two marked in the figure above, this is the top one of the
               				two, and drag it into the reference area of the other note. Pliny will respond
               				during the drag by showing you a grey box similar to that shown in the figure
               				above. When you have placed the reference where you want it release the mouse
               				button, and Pliny will create a reference there for you to "Rockwell 2005",
               				page 2.
            </li>
            <li>If the user wanted to insert a reference from one of the notes on
               				this page into the "Computer Based Text Analysis" note then this can also be
               				done. Suppose the reference to "MIMe definition" was to be copied. Its drag
               				source object is in its reference display at the left end (see it highlighted
               				above). Point the mouse pointer at it and drag that object to a place in the
               				receiving note's reference area. Pliny will respond by creating a reference to
               				"MIMe definition" in the note's reference area. <b>Note</b> that dragging
               				between notes will <i>only</i> work when one points at the specific drag source
               				object. If one points elsewhere in the references area Pliny will <i>not</i>
               				understand it as a start of a request to drag a reference from one note to
               				another -- it will see it as a request to move the object in its current
               				reference space.
            </li>
         </ul>
