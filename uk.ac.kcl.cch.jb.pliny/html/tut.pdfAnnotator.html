      <h1><a name="d1e2536">1.2.4 Using Pliny with PDF (Acrobat) files</a></h1>
      <p>Much scholarly work focuses on texts, and Pliny recognises this by
         		providing embedded support for annotating PDF (Acrobat) files. Acrobat files
         		are widely used as a publication format and scholarly materials could be
         		published in PDF format. There are, for example, ways to take TEI texts and
         		produce PDF/Acrobat formats from them. Furthermore, the presentation of the
         		text in a PDF file is generally considered stable and reliable -- a page of a
         		PDF document will normally look essentially the same on a range of different
         		computers and computer platforms.
      </p>
      <p>Pliny comes with an embedded PDF annotation tool that allows you to
         		annotate PDF documents. It takes a PDF file as if it were a sequence of images
         		-- one for each page. In the same way that a user can use Pliny's image
         		annotator to annotate an image, they can use its PDF annotation tool to
         		annotate pages of a PDF file.
      </p>
      <p><b>Note</b>: Pliny's annotation tool for PDF files is built on top of
         		the open-source version of a PDF viewer from <a href="http://www.jpedal.org/">JPedal</a>. We have also been granted permission
         		to include the <i>pjes.jar</i> library which allows the annotator to display a
         		PDF file's embedded fonts. Many thanks to IDRsolutions who have made an
         		open-source version of their viewer available, and kindly allowed us to include
         		the <i>pjes.jar</i> library.
      </p>
      <h2>Setting up the PDF File</h2>
      <p>To use the PDF annotation editor in Pliny on an PDF file one must
         		  first associate the tool with the PDF file you wish to annotate -- the file
         		  because a Pliny <i>resource</i>, and the process is called "importing a PDF
         		  file into Pliny". If you have read the Image annotation tutorial, you might
         		  recall that you needed to import images into Pliny too -- the idea is similar.
         		  To import a PDF file so that you can annotate it, you must identify the file
         		  you want to import in one of three ways, and drag it to the PDF/Acrobat folder
         		  in the Resource Explorer: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>If you have located the PDF file in Pliny's imbedded web browser,
               			 you can drag the imbedded web browser's drag source object to the PDF/Acrobat
               			 folder..
            </li>
            <li>If you have located the PDF file in another web browser outside of
               			 Pliny you can drag the icon beside the URL to the PDF/Acrobat folder.
            </li>
            <li>If you have the PDF file on your own computer you can drag the icon
               			 beside the URL to the PDF/Acrobat folder.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>These three options are illustrated here:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-tut-1.png"></p>
      <p>In all three cases a copy of the PDF file will be cached in Pliny's
         		  storage area for its internal use, and the file will open in Pliny's embedded
         		  PDF viewer.
      </p>
      <p>You will see how things look in the embedded PDF viewer in a moment,
         		  but first we should see the result of our action within the Resource Explorer.
         		  Suppose that we wish to annotate Geoffrey Rockwell's article "MIMes and
         		  MeRMAids: On the Possibility of Computer-aider Interpretation" (<i>Text
            		  Technology</i> journal, November 1, 2005:
         		  <a href="http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol14_1_08.pdf"><tt>http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol14_1_08.pdf</tt></a>). Once we
         		  have it open in Pliny's embedded web browser we can drag the item to the
         		  PDF/Acrobat folder so that Pliny can set it up for us -- caching the PDF file
         		  we have identified, and creating a Pliny resource for it. Then, if we open the
         		  Resource Explorer's PDF/Acrobat folder we will see something like the
         		  following: 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-tut-2.gif"></p>
      <p>Pliny cannot see the name of the article as it is displayed to us the
         		  PDF file, so it can only use the filename itself as the name of the resource.
         		  Let us change this to something more meaningful, say, "Rockwell 2005". We click
         		  on the current resource name which allows us to edit it, and then we type in
         		  the new name. When we are done and push the "Return" key to indicate that the
         		  editing is complete the Resource Explorer will refresh the contents to display
         		  the new name:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-tut-3.gif"></p>
      <p>Now let us turn to the main editor area in Pliny, which will be
         		  showing us the first page of this PDF file.
      </p>
      <h2>Navigating in Pliny's embedded PDF Viewer</h2>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, Pliny's embedded PDF viewer is derived from the
         		  <a href="http://www.jpedal.org/">JPedal PDF viewer software</a>. There is a lot
         		  to do to get JPedal's PDF viewer started with most PDF files so it may take a
         		  moment or so before the first page appears. Please be patient.
      </p>
      <p>When the PDF viewer does start up it will look like this:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-ref2.png"></p>
      <p>The PDF annotator has two toolbars. The lower one, labelled here
         		  "Navigation Toolbar", is inherited from the JPedal viewer and is the navigation
         		  toolbar -- PDF files contain pages, and this tool bar allows you to navigate
         		  through the collection of pages. The upper toolbar is the Pliny toolbar that we
         		  have seen with other annotators. Within it, labelled here "Annotation Toolbar",
         		  are the tools you will use to create annotations in the PDF file. See the
         		  description of all the buttons in the toolbars within the
         		  <a href="ref.referenceObject.html">reference section</a> for the PDF
         		  annotator.
      </p>
      <p>Suppose we read the first page and decide it is time to move on to the
         		  second. The navigation toolbar's "advance page button" is the one to click:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-tut-5.png"></p>
      <h2>Adding an annotation to a page of a PDF file</h2>
      <p>Page 2 is now being shown. Suppose that as we read it we decided to
         		  add an annotation that draws attention to Rockwell's definition of a
         		  "Meta-Interpretation Machine". This time we are doing an annotation and we
         		  select the Make Annotation button from the annotation toolbar (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/annotationIcon.gif">) (Keyboard shortcut: F7), and draw out
         		  the area where we want the anchor to go. Then we record or observation in the
         		  note provided, and drag the note to a place in the margin of the page so that
         		  it is out of the way, resulting in something like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-tut-6.png"></p>
      <p>Of course, we can add as many anchors, notes, etc to the page as we
         		  wish. Since PDF files are paged, each note, anchor and connection is tied to
         		  the page on which it was created and will reappear only whenever the
         		  appropriate page is viewed. Furthermore, if we use the mechanisms Pliny
         		  provides to follow a link from a note (such as "MIMe definition") to the
         		  resource on which it appears we will find that Pliny not only opens the PDF
         		  file it knows as "Rockwell 2005", but also moves to the page containing the
         		  particular note reference -- here the second page.
      </p>
      <h2>Making a reference to a PDF document</h2>
      <p>Now that we have read Rockwell's article it is time to store a
         		  reference to it in the "My Readings" note. Doing this constitutes an example of
         		  saving a reference of one kind of resource (here a PDF file) in another kind of
         		  resource (a Pliny Note).
      </p>
      <p>In the tutorial <a href="tut.plinyWithImages.html"><i>Using Pliny with
               		  Images</i></a> we created a My Images note to store references to images that
         		  we have studied, and used drag and drop <i>from</i> the Image item in the
         		  Resource Explorer <i>to</i> the My Images note's reference area to deposit a
         		  reference there. We could do exactly the same thing here if that was
         		  convenient. However, here will will use drag and drop in the <i>opposite
            		  direction</i> to achieve more or less the same result -- we will drag the PDF
         		  annotation tool's drag source object <i>to</i> the Resource Explorer to create
         		  the reference in our pre-existing "My Readings" note.
      </p>
      <p>We recall that our note to hold references to things we have read
         		  (called <i>My Readings</i>, and created in an earlier tutorial) is bookmarked,
         		  so we can open the <i>My Bookmarks</i> object in the Resource Explorer to find
         		  a reference to it there. All we have to do is pick up the PDF annotation tool's
         		  drag source object and drag it to My Readings:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-tut-7.png"></p>
      <p>When the My Readings item receives the drop it recognises it as a
         		  request to create a reference in its reference area. If we now open My Readings
         		  by double clicking on it we can see the reference that was created:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/pdf-tut-8.png"></p>
      <p>We can see the reference to our PDF file has been indeed been dropped
         		  into <i>My Reading</i>'s reference area, but Pliny doesn't know where to put
         		  the new reference in the area and arbitrarily places it near the top left
         		  corner. Having now opened <i>My Readings</i>, we can now move this reference
         		  for <i>Rockwell 2005</i> to somewhere more appropriate. Note as well in the
         		  illustration above that we have placed the pointer to point at the new
         		  reference so you can see the tooltip display associated with the item, and that
         		  this display shows as <i>Rockwell 2005 (pg 1)</i>. From this we can learn
         		  something else about references to PDF documents: they contain a reference not
         		  only to the PDF document, but also to a particular page in the document. Since
         		  the PDF viewer was showing page one of the document when we dragged its drag
         		  source object in to create the reference, the reference is to the first page.
         		  If, however, the viewer had been showing a different page of the document, the
         		  reference would have been to that page. Finally, we can also see that Pliny is
         		  put a thumbnail-sized image of the PDF document's first page in the content
         		  area of the reference object.
      </p>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
      <p>Pliny supports the annotation of PDF/Acrobat resources. PDF resources,
         		  in turn, can be created from files held on your hard disk, or harvested from
         		  PDF documents fetched from the WWW. You work with PDF files as Pliny resources
         		  using Pliny's embedded PDF viewer/annotator. PDF files usually contain more
         		  than one page, and the PDF/Acrobat annotation tool provides a Navigation
         		  Toolbar which allows you to view different pages. Annotations can be put on any
         		  page in a PDF document, and otherwise the annotator works in a way similar to
         		  the image annotator: it combines note taking with the ability to link a note to
         		  a spot on the page by means of an anchor. PDF resources appear in the Resource
         		  Explorer in the <i>PDF/Acrobat</i> folder, but you can use the Bookmarks and
         		  similar facilities provided to manage notes as a way to file PDF resources
         		  according to a scheme that suits your particular needs.
