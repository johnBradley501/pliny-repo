      <h1><a name="d1e3043">2.1.1 Resource Explorer</a></h1>
      <h2>What's it for</h2>
      <p>Pliny's Resource Explorer is both one of the starting points for using
         		  Pliny, and one of the places that you will turn to to manage the materials you
         		  give to it. It focuses on giving access to all of Pliny's resources -- notes,
         		  Web pages, PDF files, Images and other resources which have been set up to
         		  interact with Pliny. Most users will find it convenient to have the Resource
         		  Explorer on the screen at all times.
      </p>
      <p>Usually it will always appear on the screen when Pliny is being used.
         		  However, if it is not already on the screen one can open it by clicking on the
         		  Resource Explorer button (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/resourceExplorer.gif">)
         		  on the main Pliny toolbar:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-0.gif"></p>
      <h2>Visual display and operation</h2>
      <p>The Resource Explorer is a <i>View</i> in Eclipse terminology. Each
         		  Eclipse view can be displayed only once on the screen (unlike an Eclipse editor
         		  which can appear many times and can be associated with different objects, or
         		  even more than once with the same object). Views are usually displayed around
         		  the central editing area, and although the Pliny perspective places the
         		  Resource Explorer on the left edge of the Eclipse window it can be moved to a
         		  different place in the window if you wish. It is designed to work best in a
         		  window space that is longer than it is wide, so usually it should be placed on
         		  the left or right side of the Eclipse screen rather than the top or bottom.
      </p>
      <p>When first opened the Explorer looks like this:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-1.png"></p>
      <p>The tab area at the top of the view will always show "Resource
         		  Explorer" (although, of course, if the area is too narrow, Pliny will truncate
         		  the name so that only a part of it is visible). To the right of the tab are the
         		  minimize (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/closeNote.gif">) and maximize
         		  (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/openNote.gif">) icons, which can be clicked on
         		  to reduce the size of the Resource Explorer to a minimum or expand it to the
         		  full size of the Pliny window. There is more information about these buttons in
         		  the section "the Minimize and Maximize buttons" in <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes </a>.
      </p>
      <p>Below the top tab area is a grey bar which is the toolbar area
         		  provided for the Resource Explorer. The four tool icons are described in the
         		  <i>Tools</i> part of the "Commands" section below.
      </p>
      <p>The main area of the Resource Explorer's panel can contain three
         		  different displays. Which one you see is based on the tag you choose at the
         		  bottom of the Resource Explorer's panel: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>By Type</b>: this displays all the resources Pliny manages for
               			 you, and organises them by the type of resource. This is the display that the
               			 Explorer starts with when first opened.
            </li>
            <li><b>By Date</b>: this also displays all the resources Pliny manages
               			 for you, but they are organised by their date of creation. This organisation is
               			 useful if you are looking for an object you created some time ago and you can
               			 roughly remember when it was created.
            </li>
            <li><b>Search</b>: this option does not offer a complete list of all
               			 resources. Instead, you can type in the beginning of a resource's name, and in
               			 this tab Pliny will show you all the Resources with titles that begin with your
               			 letters. Use this to quickly look a resource by its name.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The display for all three tabs contains a hierarchical display in
         		  which the resources Pliny manages for you are displayed. The display is
         		  hierarchical, and exactly how it appears graphically will depend upon the kind
         		  of computer you are using (the figure above shows the hierarchical display as
         		  it is on a Windows 10 machine) because Pliny uses the display mechanisms your
         		  operating system provides for hierarchical displays if it can.
      </p>
      <p>At present Pliny always starts up by showing the "By Type" tab as the
         		  one in front. Look later in this item for information about how the "By Date"
         		  display mechanism works, although Pliny will remember the last tab you were
         		  looking at when you shut Pliny down, and will restart with the same tab showing
         		  next time you start up again. We begin here by describing how the Resource
         		  Explorer's "By Type" tab's hierarchical display is organised.
      </p>
      <p>When the Resource Explorer is first started up again the display shows
         		  only the top level of the hierarchy. For each item of that top level that
         		  contains another level the display shows the "open" icon (here a "&gt;" -- but
         		  this might be different under other GUIs such as older versions of Windows, or
         		  on the Macintosh). We describe the information at each level in the hierarchy
         		  in the following sections:
      </p>
      <h3>Top level: The Resource Type Level</h3>
      <p>The top level has one level for each <i>kind of resource</i> that
         			 Pliny manages, and the top level for the <i>My Bookmarks</i> group. <i>My
            			 Bookmarks</i> acts somewhat differently from the others and is described in its
         			 own subsection below. The others however (there are 4 in the figure above)
         			 indicate that Pliny is currently managing some Note, Web Browser, Image and
         			 PDF/Acrobat resources for you. If Pliny also held resources linked to other
         			 kinds of information the kinds would appear here as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Second level: The Initial Letter Level</h3>
      <p>If one clicks on the top open level icon one sees the second
         			 level:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-2.gif"></p>
      <p>... here we clicked on the "Web Browser" top level. Note that its
         			 "+" open icon has changed to a "-" close icon. If clicked on again it will
         			 close the 2nd level display. The entries shown at the 2nd level under all
         			 resource types are derived from the first letter of the name of the resources.
         			 We can see here that we have Web Browser resources with names beginning with
         			 "C" (3 of them), "H" (2 of them) and "O" (one of them).
      </p>
      <h3>Third Level: The Resource Level</h3>
      <p>If we open one of the 2nd level items we will see all the items at
         			 the third level that it contains. Suppose we click on the "C" item under "Web
         			 Browser". We will see:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-3.gif"></p>
      <p>Here we see the names of the three resources that are both Web
         			 Browser resources and begin with the letter "C". Note that the name of the last
         			 item extends past the right edge of the Resource Explorer's panel. We can see
         			 the full name by pointing at it and leaving the pointer pointing at it for a
         			 momemt. Eclipse will respond by displaying the associated "tool tip" -- here
         			 the full name of the item:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-4.gif"></p>
      <p>We can open any of the resources we see at this level by double
         			 clicking on the item's Icon.
      </p>
      <h3>Fourth Level: Containment Groups</h3>
      <p>The fourth and fifth hierarchical levels have to do with
         			 containment. In Pliny, containment refers to reference objects that appear in
         a
         			 resource's reference/annotation field. Here is a screen shot of the Web Browser
         			 page <i>CRSBI: Font Page img 1</i> that we have been using for our
         			 illustations:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-4a.png"></p>
      <p>The reference area to the right shows that two notes have been
         			 recorded. In Pliny terminology, these two notes are <i>contained</i> within the
         			 browser page's resource. It is important to realise that it is not so much that
         			 this web page contain two <i>notes</i>, but that it contains <i>references</i>
         			 to those two notes that might be, in turn, contained in one or more other
         			 resources as well.
      </p>
      <p>Now that we have briefly introduced containment, we are ready to
         			 look at the fourth and fifth display levels within the Resource Explorer. The
         			 fourth hierarichal level looks like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-5.gif"></p>
      <p>and shows the "containment" information associated with a resource.
         			 There are always two items at this level: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>Displayed In</b>: contains a list of items that refer to this
               				item in their reference/annotation area. In the figure there is no "+" icon
               				showing to the left of the Displayed in item because this item is not
               				referenced in any other's reference/annotation area.
            </li>
            <li><b>Contains</b>: shows the list of items that are contained in
               				this item's reference/annotation area.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Fifth Level: Containment List</h3>
      <p>The fifth level shows the list of items that are contained (or
         			 contain) the item. If we open "Contains" for the <i>CRSBI: Font Page img 1</i>
         			 item we see:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-6.gif"></p>
      <p>We can see that the reference area for the web page "CRSBI: Font
         			 Page img 1" contains two items: one called "Chipped Frame" and the other "Lily
         			 Ornamentation".
      </p>
      <h3>Lower Levels</h3>
      <p>Attached to each item contained in <i>CRSBI: Font Page img 1</i> are
         			 further levels, but they repeat the containment information displayed above.
         			 Below Chipped Frame, for example, one will see "Displayed in" and "Contains",
         			 and inside it the list of resources in which <i>Chipped Frame</i> appears or
         			 that <i>Chipped Frame</i> contains itself. The sublevels can continue
         			 indefinately.
      </p>
      <h3>My Bookmarks</h3>
      <p>The last item at the top level is labelled "My Bookmarks" and it
         			 works differently from the other items. Any resource that Pliny manages can be
         			 designated as a "bookmark" by you, and if it is it appears under the My
         			 Bookmarks item (as well as in its place like other notes in the folders
         			 structure described above. The following figure shows the My Bookmarks item
         			 open with two items showing as bookmarks (a note <i>My Images</i> and a note
         			 <i>My Readings</i>):
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-7.gif"></p>
      <p>Store as bookmarks items that you want to directly access at any
         			 time through the resource explorer. For example, you may want to use Pliny to
         			 file resources under a filing scheme of your own devising. The top level items
         			 in your own scheme might appear here as bookmarks.
      </p>
      <p>For an item to appear as a bookmark you must ask Pliny to designate
         			 it as such. See the <i>commands</i> section for information about how to do
         			 this.
      </p>
      <h2>Viewing the Resource Explorer "By Date"</h2>
      <p>Clicking on the "By Date" tab at the bottom of the Resource Explorer's
         		  pane area will cause it to switch to the view which organises Pliny resource
         		  items by the date they were created:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-8a.gif"></p>
      <p>There is always a folder for objects created today first. Following
         		  that are folders that group material together by time period, followed by the
         		  number of items they contain shown in parentheses. For example, we can see that
         		  in May 2007 639 notes were created in Pliny. If the May 2007 folder is opened
         		  we will see folders for each day in which Pliny resources were created, and
         		  then we can finally open one of the days to see the created resources
         		  themselves:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-8b.gif"></p>
      <p>Here the user has opened first the May 2007 folder, and then within it
         		  the "Mon, 21 May 2007" folder, and sees the 12 resources created on that day.
         		  Note that of the 12 created, two are resources for web pages (the first and the
         		  last displayed), and the others as all Notes.
      </p>
      <p>Resource items that appear in the Resource Explorer's "By Date"
         		  display can be used in the same way as described for the "By Type" display
         		  (Level 3 above). We can double-click on any of the resource items icon to open
         		  it. We can view the containment data for any item by clicking on the "+" button
         		  in front of it.
      </p>
      <h2>Viewing the Resource Explorer's "Search" tab</h2>
      <p>The Search tab can be used when you want to quickly locate a Resource
         		  by its name. When you first open it you will see this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-16.gif"></p>
      <p>Start typing the name of the resource you are looking for into the
         		  Search box. Nothing will happen until you reach the 2nd letter, but then Pliny
         		  will show you all resources with names that begin with the two letters you
         		  type:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-17.gif"></p>
      <p>Continue to type in more letters if you wish to refine the selection
         		  upon which the list is based more:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-18.gif"></p>
      <p>There is no need to type in the entire name of the Resource. When you
         		  see the item you want you can stop typing. Any item in the list can be used by
         		  you in any of the ways that the Resource Explorer permits. You can, for
         		  example, double click on the item's icon to open it, drag it to another part of
         		  Pliny to create a reference to it there, delete a selected item with the Delete
         		  key, or you can double click on the name and type in a new name for it
         		  (although, if the new name begins with letters other than the pattern you have
         		  already provided (here "<tt>mus</tt>"), the item will then disappear out of the
         		  displayed list since, with its new name, it no longer matches the name pattern
         		  you have specified.)
      </p>
      <h2>Commands</h2>
      <p>One can interact with the Resource Explorer in several ways: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>by means of Icons on the toolbar,</li>
            <li>by means of the contextual menu,</li>
            <li>by means of menu commands and keyboard shortcuts,</li>
            <li>by means of direct editing, and</li>
            <li>by means of drag and drop.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Toolbar</h3>
      <p>The Resource Explorer's toolbar appears under the Resource Explorer
         			 tab:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-8.png"></p>
      <p>and it contains five icons: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>New Note Command</b> (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">): invokes a one screen wizard which allows
               				you to create a new note in Pliny. Furthermore, if, at the time the New Note
               				command is invoked, more than one item is selected in the Resource Explorer
               				tree that represents a Pliny Resource, then the references to all selected
               				Resources will also be added to the new note's Reference Area. 
               				
               <p>The wizard looks like this:</p>
               <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-9.gif"></p> 
               				
               <p>The fields provided here are: 
                  				
                  <ul>
                     <li><b>Name for Note</b>: Provide the name for the new note here.
                        					 A name is obligatory. In certain situations a name may be suggested, and
                        					 already appear in this field -- but you are free to change it if you wish.
                     </li>
                     <li><b>Add to Bookmark List?</b> Tick the box if you wish the
                        					 note you are creating to be added to your bookmarks.
                     </li>
                     <li><b>Make Referent?</b> Tick this box if the note you are
                        					 creating is to be used as a referent. A reference note affects the notes that
                        					 are created after it -- in each note created subsequently a reference to this
                        					 note is made, and in the referent note a reference is to the subsequent note.
                        					 This feature is useful when one is creating notes about a single source. The
                        					 reference note becomes a note about the source, and the subsequent notes (which
                        					 will be comments about the source) will refer to the source they are about
                        					 automatically. See the tutorial <a href="tut.nonDigital.html">Using Pliny with
                           					 Non-digital Materials</a> for an example of how creating notes with a
                        					 referent could be useful.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Export Pliny Data</b> (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/export.gif">): Click on this icon when you wish to export
               				data out of Pliny into a file. Pliny provides support for two formats: (1) its
               				own archive format (PLA), and (2) a Topic Map format (XTM). See the section
               				<i>Exporting and Importing</i> for details. At present all the data Pliny is
               				holding is exported. There is at present no way to export data from a selected
               				set of resources.
            </li>
            <li><b>Import Pliny Data</b> (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/import.gif">): Click on this icon to import data from files
               				into Pliny. Pliny supports two formats for importing of data: (1) its own
               				archive format (PLA), and a plain text format (txt). See the section
               				<i>Exporting and Importing</i> for details. At present all imported data is
               				added to materials already held by Pliny. There is at present no way to use
               				imported data to completely replace data already in Pliny.
            </li>
            <li><b>Create as full/minimized reference</b> (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/openNote.gif">): When a new reference is created in Pliny it
               				is created either "full size" (showing both title and contents) or "minimized"
               				(showing title only). Click here to change from full-size creation to minimized
               				or vice-versa. The icon showing shows what is currently set: this icon shows
               				that Pliny will create full size references. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Open the Pliny Resource Holder</b> (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/resHolderView.gif">): Click on this to set up the Pliny
               				Resource Holder view. This view can be used to temproarily hold a reference to
               				a Pliny resource and is useful when copying references to Pliny objects from
               				one place to another. It is described on the help page for the
               				<a href="ref.resourceHolderView.html">Pliny Resource Holder view</a>.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>The Contextual Menu</h3>
      <p>You invoke the Resource Explorer's contextual menu by clicking on
         			 the right (other) mouse button (or, on the Macintosh, click while holding down
         			 the Ctrl key). It looks like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-10.gif"></p>
      <p>The list of items will vary depending upon (a) whether an item is
         			 selected or not, and what is selected, and (b) what other Eclipse plugins
         			 installed with Pliny might have a useful tool to contribute. To choose an item
         			 from the menu point at it with the mouse and click.
      </p>
      <p>The set of possible Contextual Menu commands are: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>Create Note...</b>: use this command to request a new note to
               				be created. It operates in exactly the same way as the Resource Explorer's
               				toolbar icon.
            </li>
            <li><b>Add to Bookmarks</b>: This command will appear when one or
               				more items are selected within the explorer, and the items are not currently
               				bookmarks. Choose this item to make the selected item(s) bookmarks so that they
               				will appear in the Bookmarks display.
            </li>
            <li><b>Remove from Bookmarks</b>: This command will appear when one
               				or more items are selected that are currently acting as bookmarks. Choose this
               				item to remove them from the bookmark list. It does not delete the item
               				itself.
            </li>
            <li><b>Set the Referent</b>: This command will appear when one item
               				is selected. Choose it if you want the item to act as a referent: a note that
               				subsequent notes you create will automatically refer to. Use the "Clear the
               				Referent" command when you subsequently want to turn this option off. See the
               				tutorial <a href="tut.nonDigital.html">Using Pliny with Non-digital
                  				Materials</a> for an example of how creating notes with a referent could be
               				useful.
            </li>
            <li><b>Clear the Referent</b>: This command will appear when a
               				resource is set to act as a referent. An item can be designated a referent when
               				either that option was previously chosen in the "New Note" wizard screen, or
               				when the "Set the Referent" item was previously chosen. Choosing this item
               				stops the current referent as acting as one any more.
            </li>
            <li><b>Update resource's URL</b>: This command will appear when a
               				selected Web Browser item is chosen. It allows you to update the URL associated
               				with the item and is useful if a page's URL has been changed on the World Wide
               				Web.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Menu Commands, Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
      <p>Several keyboard commands (shortcuts) are supported within the
         			 Resource Explorer: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>Undo/Redo</b>: Choose Undo from the Edit menu (or type the
               				appropriate key sequence for your machine) to undo a previous command you have
               				given to the Resource Explorer. Redo will repeat the command that you just
               				undid. In general Pliny supports multiple-undo.
            </li>
            <li><b>Delete</b>: Push the delete key (or choose <i>Delete</i> from
               				the edit menu) to delete selected resource items from Pliny. When you push the
               				delete key Pliny will respond with a confirmation dialog box to be sure that
               				you want to delete the item. Delete items are undoable. The delete key has a
               				different function when you are editing the name of a resource -- then it is
               				used as textual delete -- to delete selected text or the character following
               				the insertion point.
            </li>
            <li><b>Copy</b>: push the copy key to copy a reference to the current
               				selected resource item (or items) to the clipboard. Paste can then be used to
               				paste this reference into, say, a reference area.
            </li>
            <li><b>Double-click</b>: on a resource (either the name, or the icon
               				in front of it) to open it in the "editor pane".
            </li>
            <li><b>Single-Click</b>: on the name of a resource to allow you to
               				edit it. This is <i>direct Edit</i> -- described in the next section.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Direct Edit</h3>
      <p>You can change the name of a resource in the Resource Explorer. To
         			 indicate that you wish to do so single-click on the resource's name. Pliny will
         			 respond by displaying the name in reverse colouring and providing a blinking
         			 insertion point:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-11.gif"></p>
      <p>If you type immediately you will be replacing the entire name with a
         			 new name. Alternatively, you can move the insertion point in the name to make
         			 textual changes to only a part of it.
      </p>
      <p>When you are finished editing the name click elsewhere to indicate
         			 that the editing is done. Pliny will respond by updating the name. Remember
         			 that if you change the name the item may change its location in the list (since
         			 Pliny shows the names of resources here in alphabetical order), or move to
         			 another initial letter (if you changed the first letter of the name)!
      </p>
      <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
      <p>The Resource Explorer provides drag and drop support both as a source
         		  (dragging out) and a target (dragging in).
      </p>
      <h3>Dragging Out (Source)</h3>
      <p>Any resource item displayed by the Explorer can be used a source for
         			 a drag. A drag from a resource item in the Resource Explorer to a target
         			 reference area is interpreted by Pliny as a request to create a reference to
         			 that item in the target.
      </p>
      <p>An item can also be dragged to the
         			 <a href="ref.resourceHolderView.html">Resource Holder</a> view to create a
         			 temporary reference that could be used later in the Pliny session.
      </p>
      <h3>Dragging In (Resource Explorer as the Target)</h3>
      <p>There are four kinds of target items in the Resource Explorer: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>A Resource Item</b>: You can drag an item representing a
               				resource to another resource. This is interpreted as a request to create a
               				reference to that item in the target item:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-12.png"></p> 
               				
               <p>The above figure shows three different possible sources that can
                  				  be used. If the middle drag source (from the Note "Leaf Motif") is dragged to
                  				  the item "Lily Ornamentation" in the Resource Explorer a reference to it will
                  				  be created. If the "drag source" from Leaf Motif: About is dragged to "Lily
                  				  Ornamentation" then a reference to "Leaf Motif: About" will be created in "Lily
                  				  Ornamentation". Finally, note that a one object in the Resource Explorer can
                  be
                  				  dragged to another source. If the "Leaf Motif" item in the Explorer is dragged
                  				  to "Lily Ornamentation" also in the Explorer, then a reference to "Leaf Motif"
                  				  will be created in "Lily Ornamentation".
               </p> 
               				
               <p>Note that when an object is dragged to to a Resource Item the
                  				  placement of that created resource on the items' resource/annotation area is
                  an
                  				  issue. If a reference (in the above figure the right-most drag source is an
                  				  example) is dragged, then its position in the source is used to place it in
                  the
                  				  target as well. If, however, the reference is created as a result of the
                  				  dragging of an object which represents a resource (as it is for the other two
                  				  sample drag sources in the above figure), then no position or size can be
                  				  implied. In these situations Pliny places the newly created reference near the
                  				  top left of the destination reference/annotation area, and makes it a standard
                  				  size -- even if this overlaps or obscures another reference that is already
                  				  there.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>To the "Image" folder</b>: an image or a web page can be
               				dragged to the <i>Image</i> folder in the Resource Explorer. This is
               				interpreted as a request to import one or more images into Pliny's image
               				annotator. For more information about this see the section <i>Importing an
                  				Image</i> in the section <a href="ref.imageAnnotator.html">Image
                  				Annotator</a>.
            </li>
            <li><b>To the "PDF/Acrobat" folder</b>: a PDF file from your machine
               				or fetched over the WWW can be dragged to the <i>PDF/Acrobat</i> folder in the
               				Resource Explorer. This is interpreted as a request to import it into Pliny's
               				PDF annotator. For more information about this see the section <i>Importing a
                  				PDF file</i> in the section <a href="ref.pdfAnnotator.html">PDF
                  				Annotator</a>.
            </li>
            <li><b>To the "My Bookmarks" folder</b>: You can create a new
               				bookmark by dragging the Pliny object you wish to bookmark to the bookmark
               				folder. You can start the drag from any draggable object that represents the
               				item, including: 
               				
               <ul>
                  <li>the draggable top left icon in any reference item,</li>
                  <li>any resource listed elsewhere in the Resource Explorer, </li>
                  <li>any annotator's drag and drop object, or</li>
                  <li>from an item in the Pliny Resource Holder view.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Exporting and Importing Pliny Data</h2>
      <p>One accesses Pliny's exporting and importing mechanisms through the
         		  export (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/export.gif">) and import (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/import.gif">) icons on the Resource Explorer's toolbar.
      </p>
      <h3>Exporting Pliny Data</h3>
      <p>Data can be exported in two formats: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>PLA format</b>: a zip-file format containing various cache
               				objects and a master XML file that can be re-imported back into Pliny, and will
               				recreate all the resource, reference, type and object data. Use this format to
               				backup and archive your Pliny data.
            </li>
            <li><b>XTM format</b>: an XML format that represents much of the
               				Pliny data as a <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/topicMaps.html">Topic
                  				Map</a>. Not all the information that Pliny holds about its objects finds its
               				way into the Topic Map, and furthermore Topic Maps can describe its objects in
               				ways that are not compatible with Pliny -- thus, although you can export data
               				into a Topic Map format, you cannot import from a Topic Map again. Use this
               				format if you wish to move material out of Pliny into a system that understands
               				Topic Maps. 
               				
               <p><i>Note</i>: Pliny can generate an enriched Topic Map if you
                  				  take advantage of Pliny's <i>type</i> mechanisms. See the section about them in
                  				  the reference section to Pliny's <a href="ref.typeManagerView.html">Type
                     				  manager</a> for more information.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>When you request a data export by clicking on the export icon
         			 (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/export.gif">) Pliny responds by showing you its
         			 export file dialog box:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-13.gif"></p>
      <p>This dialog box is a conventional "file save" box, and its
         			 appearance will be different on different computing systems. Here we see the
         			 format as it is on a Windows XP machine. Use this box in the usual way to place
         			 the file where you want it on your machine and to provide a suitable filename.
         			 
      </p>
      <p>Note the "Save as type" option near the bottom. This is where we
         			 indicate whether we are writing out a PLA (Pliny archive) or XTM (Topic Map)
         			 file. Pliny starts off assuming that you want to create a Pliny Archive (PLA)
         			 file. Choose the other option "TopicMap File" (this is shown in the figure
         			 above) to request an archive to be created in XTM format.
      </p>
      <p>When you push the "Save" button Pliny will check to see if the file
         			 you specify already exists. If it does it will confirm that you want to
         			 overwrite it. If you do, or if the file name does not already exist, Pliny will
         			 move directly to its export process. The export process might well take a
         			 little time to run. If it does so Pliny will display a dialog box showing you
         			 that the exporting process is under way. It will go away when the exporting is
         			 finished.
      </p>
      <h3>Importing Pliny Data</h3>
      <p>Data can be imported from two formats: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>PLA format</b>: an zipfile storage format that can be exported
               				from Pliny (see the section <i>Exporting Data</i> just above this one), and
               				will recreate all the resouce, reference, type and object data. Use this format
               				to restore your Pliny data.
            </li>
            <li><b>Plain Text format</b>: A text format for notes. You can create
               				this format in a plain-text editor such as NotePad outside of Pliny and then
               				import the material in this format. A colleague creates notes as he is reading
               				on the train into a hand-held device. By creating notes about what he is
               				reading in this way he can subsequently import them into Pliny when he gets
               				home. There is more information about how to format the Plain Text format in
               				the section <i>Plain Text Import Format</i> below.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>When you request a data import by clicking on the export icon
         			 (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/import.gif">) Pliny responds by showing you its
         			 import file dialog box:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-14.gif"></p>
      <p>The dialog box is the normal "open file" dialog box used by your
         			 operating system (the one showing here comes from Windows XP). Use it to locate
         			 the file you wish to import.
      </p>
      <p>If you have chosen a PLA import then the import will proceed
         			 immediately.
      </p>
      <p>If, alternatively, you have chosen a plain text import then you will
         			 next see the Text Importing dialog box:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/re-ref-15.gif"></p>
      <p>There are three things you can set here: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>Starting point</b>: specify a resource that is to receive a
               				reference for items that will be created as a result of the importing.
               				Generally materials in a text file contain text for notes, and some of the
               				notes will be referents. If there are referents, the starting point note will
               				receive a reference for each referent that is created. You can choose a
               				<i>starting point</i> from your bookmarked resources.
            </li>
            <li><b>Marker for Note</b>: notes are separated from each other in a
               				text file by a text marker that appears in the first position of a line.
               				Specify here the marker you wish to use to announce the beginning of a new
               				note. Note that by default a single equal sign is used for this purpose. There
               				must be a text marker.
            </li>
            <li><b>Marker for Referent Note</b>: it is possible that you have
               				read several different works in creating your text import file -- in which case
               				the notes will come from different sources. In this situation you may wish to
               				record information about each source as a referent. Provide here the marker to
               				be used to announce a note which is also to act as a referent for notes that
               				follow. Be default a pair of equal signs is used for this purpose.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>After you have provided information in this text importing wizard
         			 you should push "Finish" which wil begin the text importing process.
      </p>
      <h3>Plain Text Import Format</h3>
      <p>A plain text file contains information which Pliny will interpret as
         			 a set of notes it is to create. It needs to be a "plain text" file (on windows
         			 machines these can be created by NotePad, for example). It is common for a
         			 single file to contain more than one note. If so, notes are separated from each
         			 other by a <i>note marker</i> -- a sequence of characters that appears at the
         			 very beginning of the line to announce the beginning of a new note. You can set
         			 the marker to be a string of characters when you fill in the Text Importing
         			 Wizard (see the previous section), but by default the note marker is "=". A
         			 note title can be put on the same line, following the note marker. Thus a
         			 typical note might look like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote><pre style="background-color=#FFFFE0">= Wittig 1978: CBLA: text as linear
text is linearly defined -&gt; "syntagmatic analysis" 
(Allen Dundes), or "metanymic" anlysis (Roman Jakobson)

Claude Levi-Strauss points out ...
"emphasizes [...] the diachronically-ordered components 
of the text" ... "invariably surface-structure features, 
and of relatively little consequence in the decoding 
of the text"

instead "paradigmatic deep-structural analysis" is needed. (p 212).

Wittig:
"these works are built upon network relationships far 
too complex to be reduced to a linear structure".
</pre></blockquote>
      <p>The first line begins with the note marker ("=") to announce a new
         			 note. Following it on the same line is the name to be associated with the note,
         			 here "<tt>Wittig 1978: CBLA: text as linear</tt>". Subsequent lines contain the
         			 body of the note. Note that blank lines will appear as a part of the note's
         			 body. Indeed, all material following the note marker will appear in the note
         			 until either the file ends, or another note marker is found.
      </p>
      <p>The <i>referent maker</i> (by default "<tt>==</tt>") can be used to
         			 announce the beginning of a new note that is also to act as a referent. Usually
         			 a referent note describes the material that was read as the source for the
         			 notes that follow. A typical referent entry would be:
      </p>
      <blockquote><pre style="background-color=#FFFFE0">== Wittig 1978
Susan Wittig (1978). The computer and the Concept of Text. 
In Computers and the Humanities Vol 11 pp 211-215.
</pre></blockquote>
      <p>As before, the title for the referent (here "<i>Wittig 1978</i>")
         			 appears on the same line as the referent marker, and the lines following it
         			 contain the body of the referent note.
      </p>
      <p>If a referent is used it should precede the notes to which it
         			 applies. If you wish to include notes derived from more than one source you can
         			 put the referent for the first source in at the beginning of the file, followed
         			 by the notes that belong to it, then the referent for the second source,
         			 followed by its notes, and so on.
