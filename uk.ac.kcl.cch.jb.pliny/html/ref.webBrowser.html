      <h1><a name="d1e4332">2.1.5 Web Browser</a></h1>
      <p>This section provides a reference section for the embedded Web Browser.
         		If you are unfamiliar with how to use the browser within Pliny, see
         		<a href="tut.plinyWithWeb.html">the tutorial on this subject</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>What's it for</h2>
      <p>Pliny's embedded Web Browser should be invoked whenever you wish to
         		  attach Pliny resources such as notes to a web page. Although a web browser
         		  (configurable in Eclipse, but generally it will be an established browser
         		  already on your computer such as Internet Explorer or FireFox). It is an
         		  editor, so it will launch an editing space in the editor pane.
      </p>
      <h2>Starting the Browser</h2>
      <p>Pliny's embedded web browser can be started in any of three ways: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>Click on the Browser icon from the Eclipse main toolbar:
               			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/browserIcon.gif">. Unless you have changed your
               			 home page setting (see how to do that in the section <i>Browser Controls</i>,
               			 below), the browser will start with <tt>http://pliny.cch.kcl.ac.uk</tt> as its
               			 default "homepage".
            </li>
            <li>Choose the "open" action from any reference to a web page
               			 (identified with<img align="middle" src="images/icons/browserIcon.gif"> in its top left
               			 corner). This will cause Pliny to launch the web browser and point it at the
               			 web page to which the reference refers.
            </li>
            <li>Choose a web page reference from the resource explorer. Pliny will
               			 launch the web browser and point it at the web page the reference
               			 specified.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>If you shut down Pliny (or Eclipse if you are using Pliny as a plugin)
         		  when the browser is open, Pliny will remember that the browser was running at
         		  the time, and will reopen it when it is restarted at the page it is currently
         		  showing.
      </p>
      <h2>Screen components</h2>
      <p>Here is a typical display of the embedded Web Browser, with its parts
         		  labelled: 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-screen.gif"></p>
      <p>The embedded browser appears with Pliny's standard toolbar at the top,
         		  and two major areas below it divided by a bounday (labelled "Boundary" above).
         
         		
         <ul>
            <li>To the left is the <i>browser area</i>. Web pages fetched by the
               			 browser appear in the large bottom left area. You can operate in this area
               			 exactly as you do in your normal browser -- clicking on links that appear for
               			 example to navigate to another web page. The top area (labelled "Browser
               			 Controls" above) contains buttons that control the browser. See details about
               			 their description in the subsection Browser Controls below.
            </li>
            <li>To the right is the <i>reference area</i> associated with this
               			 page. You can create references to notes in this area that you wish to
               			 associate with the browser page you are seeing at any time. Whenever you return
               			 to this same page your associated notes will reappear here.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Tab</h3>
      <p>A row of tabs appear at the top of this pane, as it does above any
         			 of Pliny's annotators/editors. The highlighted one (in the figure, "Pliny:
         			 Welcome") belongs to the main screen area below. The "X" icon can be clicked on
         			 to close the object. The name that appears in the tab is one of two
         			 possibilities: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>If the web page is already stored as a Pliny resource, then the
               				name of the resource will appear here.
            </li>
            <li>If the page is being displayed from the WWW, but is not currently
               				a Pliny resource, then the name here is the name your browser would normally
               				show as the page's name -- often the page's "title", but perhaps the page's URL
               				if it doesn't have a title.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Boundary</h3>
      <p>The reference area is separated from the browser areas by a
         			 boundary. Drag the boundary area left or right to change the proportion of
         			 screen are given to the two portions.
      </p>
      <h3>Browser Controls</h3>
      <p>The browser has its own toolbar area, and it looks like this:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-toolbar.png"></p>
      <p>The areas on it are: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>Back Button:</b> This is the normal browser "back"
               				button.
            </li>
            <li><b>Forward Button</b>: This is the normal browser "forward"
               				button.
            </li>
            <li><b>Stop Button</b>: This is the normal browser "stop"
               				button.
            </li>
            <li><b>Refresh Button</b>: This is the normal browser "refresh page"
               				button.
            </li>
            <li><b>Home Button</b>: This is the normal "home" button. By default,
               				the home page for Pliny's embedded browser is
               				<tt>http://pliny.cch.kcl.ac.uk</tt>, but you can change this. 
               				
               <ul>
                  <li>First, navigate to the page you want to use as your home
                     					 page.
                  </li>
                  <li>Then click on the dropdown button to the right of the Home
                     					 icon itself (<img align="middle" src="images/pull-down.gif">). This invokes the home
                     					 button's associated dropdown menu which contains a set of commands associated
                     					 with the Home button.
                  </li>
                  <li>Click on the option "Make current home":
                     					 
                     <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-setHome.gif"></p> 
                     					 
                     <p>This will reset the home page to the page you are currently
                        						viewing.
                     </p>
                  </li>
               </ul> 
            </li>
            <li><b>Go Button</b>: This is the normal browser "go" button.
            </li>
            <li><b>Current URL</b>: This field is the place where the current URL
               				is shown. You can also use it to make the browser go to a new web page: 
               				
               <ul>
                  <li>You can type in the URL of the page, or paste a URL in from
                     					 an outside source.
                  </li>
                  <li>The Current URL area is a drop-down menu which lists page you
                     					 have referenced recently -- what in your regular browser is called the
                     					 <i>history list</i>. You can return to one of these pages by choosing it from
                     					 the list.
                  </li>
                  <li>You can drag a URL appearing in a browser outside of Pliny to
                     					 this area to make the Pliny browser go to the same page.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Harvest Images</b>: This is a button that, when pressed,
               				causes Pliny to look for suitable images on the current webpage and to turn
               				them into Image Resources that can be annotated. There is an example of its use
               				in the tutorial <a href="tut.plinyWithImages.html">using Pliny with
                  				Images</a>.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Reference Area</h3>
      <p>This is the area where you can make notes about this webpage in the
         			 form of references to notes or to other Pliny resources. The Reference area
         			 provides a working 2D space for laying out the <a href="ref.referenceObject.html">reference objects</a>. There is more about the
         			 Reference area <a href="ref.referenceObject.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Pliny ToolBar</h2>
      <p>The toolbar for the Browser is Pliny's "Pliny Toolbar" and contains
         		  tools that work with the Browser's Reference area. It looks like this, with its
         		  parts labelled:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-pliny-toolbar.gif"></p>
      <p>Looking left to right we find: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>First, there is the browser annotators <b>Drag and Drop</b> object.
               			 The next section describes its use in the section "<i>Out of</i> the
               			 Browser".
            </li>
            <li>To the right of this is a text field, labelled here the <b>Resource
                  			 Name</b>. When Pliny saves a reference to a web page, or the browser points to
               			 a page that has a resource already attached to it, the name of the web page
               			 resource is shown here. It can be edited to whatever you like. When a page is
               			 newly loaded, the default resource name used is the web page's title (usually
               			 shown in the browser's tab), and if the page has no title, the URL for the page
               			 is used.
            </li>
            <li>To the right end of the Pliny Toolbar are the tools to support
               			 annotation and notetaking, called here the <b>Annotation Toolbar</b>. The tools
               			 and their icons are: 
               			 
               <ul>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/referencersOn.gif">: Use this
                     				  icon by clicking on the down arrow symbol (<img align="middle" src="images/pull-down.gif">) to its right rather than the icon itself.
                     				  Clicking the down-arrow will cause Pliny to generate a list of all resources
                     				  managed by Pliny that refer to the current page. To open one of these
                     				  resources, choose it from the list.
                  </li>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/undo.gif">: This icon allows you
                     				  to undo the previous action you have done in the Reference area. Undo can also
                     				  be chosen from the "Edit" menu, or requested using the standard keystroke for
                     				  your platform.
                  </li>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/redo.gif">: This icon allows you
                     				  to redo an action you have just undone in the Reference area. Redo is also
                     				  available from the "Edit" menu, or can be requested by the standard keystroke
                     				  for redo.
                  </li>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">: This icon allows
                     				  you to create a new note and a note reference for it that will appear in the
                     				  Annotation area. You can use it in two ways: 
                     				  
                     <ol>
                        <li>first click on the
                           						<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> button, then in the annotation
                           						area drag over the area there that you wish to be used for the space the
                           						reference is to occupy, or
                        </li>
                        <li>you can drag the
                           						<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> button itself into the annotation
                           						area. This will give you a "standard size" note which you can later change its
                           						size.
                        </li>
                     </ol> After Pliny has responded and created a reference and new
                     				  note for you, you will want to type in the note name and its text in the newly
                     				  created space. Each time a new note is created the "create new note" state is
                     				  cleared, and you must push the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
                     				  again to create another note or drag a new note from the
                     				  <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> button. There is a keyboard
                     				  shortcut that puts Pliny in "create new note" state as well: F5).
                  </li>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">: This icon
                     				  allows you to create a connection between two references (a line joining them).
                     				  A connection is usually used to represent some sort of conceptual connection
                     				  between the two items.. To establish a connection line first click on the
                     				  <img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">, then click in the reference
                     				  that should hold the start of the line, and drag to the reference where the
                     				  line should end. Each time you wish to create a new connection you must first
                     				  push the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif"> again. Keyboard
                     				  Shortcut: F6.
                  </li>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/allClose.gif">: Click on this
                     				  icon to cause all the references in this reference area to be minimized.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
      <p>An important element of Pliny's design was expressed in the work
         		  involved in trying to make the creation of resources and references as
         		  straight-forward as possible. To this end we have added various drag and drop
         		  features to Pliny. We have already shown that references can be dragged about
         		  in a reference area -- that is how you make use of the 2D space the reference
         		  area provided to organise the notes. However, drag and drop can also be used to
         		  copy materials from outside Pliny's integrated web browser into it, or from
         		  inside the browser's reference area to other areas. Here is a summary of these
         		  drag and drop features available in the WEb Browser:
      </p>
      <h3><i>Into</i> the Browser
      </h3>
      <p>Here are the kind of things that can be dragged from elsewhere into
         			 the browser's reference area: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>A reference to any resource can be dragged from the Resource
               				Manager to the 2D reference area. Pliny will interpret this as a request to
               				create a reference to that resource there. A reference to a note in the Note
               				Search View works the same way.
            </li>
            <li>If you have more than one editor open at the same time you can
               				drag a reference from one into the other by dragging the reference's <i>drag
                  				source object</i>. See the figure in the section <i>Out of the Browser</i> to
               				see where the drag source objects are.
            </li>
            <li>Text can be selected from another program that supports Drag and
               				Drop (such as Word) outside of Pliny and dragged onto the reference area
               				attached to a browser page. Pliny will interpret this as a request to create a
               				note and a reference to it in the area. If the dragged text begins with a short
               				line of text that looks like a heading, Pliny will interpret this as the note's
               				title.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Finally, a URL can be dragged from an external browser into the
         			 integrated browser's <i>current URL</i> field. This will cause the browser to
         			 redirect itself to that page.
      </p>
      <h3><i>Out of </i>the Browser
      </h3>
      <p>The integrated browser provides two kinds of drag source objects
         			 that can be dragged from the note editor into another Pliny object. The
         			 following figure shows them:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-dnd.png"></p>
      <p>Here we see Pliny displaying a note in the top area and the browser
         			 in the bottom (the help section "Dividing a Pane: docking" in the topic
         			 <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes</a> describes how to split the Pliny
         			 window in this way). The top part contains the note "Read Materials" and the
         			 bottom is displaying the web page for Pliny the Elder's <i>Natural History</i>
         			 from the Perseus project. A Pliny user can use one of the two drag source
         			 objects shown to make a reference from something in the browser to the
         			 reference area in the note. 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>If the user wanted to insert a reference to Perseus's web page
               				<i>Natural History</i> in his/her "Read Materials" note, s/he should point at
               				the drag source object belonging to the the web page (of the two marked in the
               				figure above, this is the one to the left), and drag it into the reference area
               				of the other note. Pliny will respond during the drag by showing you a grey box
               				similar to that shown in the figure above. When you have placed the reference
               				where you want it release the mouse button.
            </li>
            <li>If the user wanted to insert a reference to one of the objects in
               				the web page's reference area this can also be done. Suppose the reference to
               				the note about the translator was to be copied. Its drag source object is in
               				its reference object at the left end (see it highlighted above). Point the
               				mouse pointer at it and drag that object to a place in the receiving note's
               				reference area. <b>Note</b> that dragging between notes will <i>only</i> work
               				when one points at the specific drag source object. If one points elsewhere in
               				the reference object Pliny will <i>not</i> understand it as a start of a
               				request to drag a reference from one note to another -- it will see it as a
               				request to move the object in its current reference space.
