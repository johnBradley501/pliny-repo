      <h1><a name="d1e382">1.1.2 Toolbars</a></h1>
      <p>Eclipse-supported software like <i>Pliny</i> has potentially more than
         		one area for Toolbars, and there are indeed three in the screen figure shown in
         		the previous section. 
         	 
         <ul>
            <li>The main tool bar area, as shown in the screen-shot above, looks like
               		  this: 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/toolbar1.gif"></p> 
               		  
               <p>In the toolbar you can see a set of icons divided into two areas.
                  			 Think of the Icons as buttons -- they are clickable and provide ways to get
                  			 Pliny and/or Eclipse to carry out some operation for you. The main toolbar
                  			 provides a place for icons/tools of a general purpose nature.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>In addition to the main tool bar, tool bars can be provided by
               		  Eclipse views, and the tool icons then appear in the view's pane. You can see
               		  an example of this in the little tool bar that appears in the Resource
               		  Explorer's pane in the screen snapshot we showed earlier:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/toolbar2.gif"></p> 
               		  
               <p>Think of these icons as providing functions specifically useful to
                  			 the Resource Explorer view. See a description of these buttons in the section
                  			 on the <a href="ref.resourceExplorer.html">Resource Explorer</a>.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>Finally, most of Pliny's editors have a toolbar area at or near the
               		  top of their display area. You can see an example of this inside the <i>Vico
                  		  Frontispiece</i> just below its tab, and to the right:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/toolbar3.gif"></p> 
               		  
               <p>Like those that appear with views, these icons provide functions
                  			 needed for the particular editor. Since we see the image annotator here, we can
                  			 find a description of this particular set of icons in the section on the
                  			 <a href="ref.imageAnnotator.html">Image Annotator</a>.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Toolbars in Eclipse are sometimes called Action Bars because they
         		provide icons that, when clicked, perform <i>actions</i>. In the main toolbar
         		you can see that the icons are grouped into two areas, at the left and right
         		end of the toolbar area (with a field called <i>Quick Access</i> which does
         		nothing in Pliny between them). The two groups are generically called <i>Action
            		Sets</i>, and as mentioned before, the contents of any particular action set,
         		and what action sets are shown to you will depend upon what functions you are
         		doing with Eclipse. The two action sets showing in the main toolbar are: 
         	 
         <ul>
            <li><b>Eclipse's Navigation Toolbar</b>:
               		  <img align="middle" src="images/nav-toolbar.gif"> provides a set of navigation buttons
               		  that work in ways similar to your web browser's "back" and "forward" buttons.
               		  In the context of Pliny, they operate by allowing you to view Pliny resources
               		  that you have worked on earlier in the current session. Note the two little
               		  down-pointing arrows (<img align="middle" src="images/pull-down.gif">). When this kind
               		  of symbol is shown beside an icon it means that there is a drop-down menu
               		  available. Show the drop-down menu by clicking on the little arrow. In the case
               		  of the one beside the "back" button, Eclipse will show you a list of all the
               		  materials you have recently seen in this session.
            </li>
            <li><b><i>Pliny</i>'s Basic Toolbar</b>:
               		  <img align="middle" src="images/pliny-toolbar.gif"> provides a basic way to start up
               		  various Pliny operations. There are five icons here, and they do the following:
               		  
               		  
               <ul>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/resourceExplorer.gif">: The
                     				<b>Resource Explorer button</b> opens Pliny's <a href="ref.resourceExplorer.html">Resource Explorer</a> view. On the screen shown
                     				above it is already open, but if it was not visible pushing this icon would
                     				display it for you.
                  </li>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/browserIcon.gif">: The <b>Pliny
                        				Browser button</b> opens Pliny's embedded <i>Web browser</i>. The web browser
                     				is not showing in the screen shown above. The web browser displays your
                     				conventional web browser (for example, Internet Explorer or FireFox) in an
                     				Eclipse Editor pane, and allows you to use web pages as resources for Pliny's
                     				note taking or annotation. There is more about this in the section on
                     				<a href="ref.webBrowser.html">Pliny's Web Browser</a>, and the tutorial
                     				<a href="tut.plinyWithWeb.html">Using Pliny with Web-based material</a>s.
                  </li>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/annotationViewerIcon.gif">: The
                     				<b>Annotation View button</b> opens Pliny's Annotation View. If you stick to
                     				the tools provided within Pliny (or other Pliny-aware applications) to work
                     				with your data you will not need the Annotation View. Indeed, if you are using
                     				Pliny's stand-alone version you probably won't need to use the Annotation View
                     				at all, since only Pliny-aware tools are available. However, the view provides
                     				a way to attach Pliny-managed notes and annotations to materials being
                     				displayed by editors belonging to Eclipse applications that are not
                     				Pliny-aware. There is more about the annotation view in the
                     				<a href="ref.annotationView.html">Annotation View</a> section.
                  </li>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/containmentIcon.gif">: The
                     				<b>Containment View button</b> opens Pliny's Containment View which can be used
                     				to help you sort out containment-type relationships between resources. There is
                     				more discussion about the containment view in the<a href="ref.containmentView.html">Containment View Section</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/searchIcon.gif">: The <b>Note
                        				Search View button</b> opens Pliny's Note Search View which can be used to
                     				search for notes that contain words that you have used in their content. There
                     				is more about the note search view in the <a href="ref.noteSearchView.html">Note
                        				Search View Section</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/typeIcon.gif">: The <b>Type Manager
                        				View button</b> opens Pliny's Type Manager View which can be used to manage the
                     				Pliny's types. The pull-down indicator <img align="middle" src="images/pull-down.gif">
                     				that follows the button belongs with it and shows that there is a pull-down
                     				menu attached to this item. There is more about the Type Manager, the
                     				associated pull-down menu and about types in the
                     				<a href="ref.typeManagerView.html">Type Manager View Section</a>.
                  </li>
