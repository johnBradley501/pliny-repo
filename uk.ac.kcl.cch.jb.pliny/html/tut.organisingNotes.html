      <h1><a name="d1e2675">1.2.5 Using Pliny to organise notes</a></h1>
      <p>In this tutorial we will examine how one can begin to use Pliny's 2D
         		reference space to organise notes you have made about materials you have been
         		reading. In this tutorial we take as an example what could be done to assist us
         		in developing a representation of some of the issues that we discover while we
         		are doing a study on the role of 2D space to support scholarly study, but of
         		course could be applied to a broad range of other areas of interest.
      </p>
      <p>Before we start we assume that we have already collected a number of
         		examples of interest to us (described somewhat more fully shortly). Having
         		already done this, we begin by creating a note where the different uses of
         		space for study that we have so far observed will be brought together. To
         		create this new organising note we push the New Note button in the Resource
         		Explorer (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">)as usual, and name the
         		new note <i>uses of space for study</i> in the New Note wizard:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/organise-tut-1.gif"></p>
      <p>Note that we also ticked the "Add to Bookmark List" so that our
         		bookmarks will provide an easy way to find this note again in future. At some
         		point in the future when we have begun to organise many of our notes into a set
         		of concepts we are interested we might find that filing them all as bookmarks
         		will become too cumbersome. When that happens perhaps we will wish to create an
         		overall holder for all our conceptual notes to help us organise and keep track
         		of them, and call it something like <i>My Concepts</i> and file that among our
         		bookmarks instead. Then, a note such as our <i>uses of space for study</i> one
         		could be filed within the My Concepts note, and we would be able to then find
         		<i>uses of space for study</i>, and the other concept items we also filed on it
         		there.
      </p>
      <p>Returning now to the development of our <i>uses of space for study</i>
         		note: we will find that after we push the "Finish" button on the New Note
         		wizard, Pliny will create this new note for us and open it for us in the Note
         		Editor so that we can begin work on it immediately. We are going to use this
         		note mainly as a place for organising our materials in its 2D space -- a task
         		suited to the note's reference area, so we move the boundary between the
         		reference area and the note contents well to the left to give more room to the
         		reference area. Pliny will remember where we placed the boundary so that if we
         		close this note and open it later the boundary will appear next time where we
         		left it. The result will be something like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/organise-tut-2.png"></p>
      <p>In our study we have collected a number of examples of images that show
         		the use of space for scholarly research purposes. One of them is a screen shot
         		of a distribution graph produced from data generated by a statistical method
         		called <i>Correspondence Analysis</i>, and we have already annoted the image to
         		remind us about how we should interpret such a graph:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/organise-tut-3.png"></p>
      <p>This is clearly an example of a use of a 2D space for scholarly study,
         		so we switch back to our <i>uses of space for study</i> note by clicking on the
         		tab that is showing to the left of the Simweb sample image tab to return to the
         		note we created a few minutes ago and drag a reference from the <i>Simweb
            		sample image</i> resource showing in the Resource Explorer to the <i>uses of
            		space for study</i> page:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/organise-tut-4.png"></p>
      <p>After the reference to the simweb graph is created we can click on its
         		open icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/openNote.gif">) to display it more
         		fully if need be. This will result in something like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/organise-tut-5.png"></p>
      <p>Now, repeating this operation several times we locate several other
         		images we have already in our Pliny storage that refer to space and scholarly
         		study and drag references of them all to this page, resulting in something like
         		this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/organise-tut-6.png"></p>
      <p>After looking at the four examples we have assembled here for a moment,
         		we notice that they divide into two categories of interest to us: 
         	 
         <ul>
            <li><i>Cartesian</i>: for two of the images (Simweb sample image) and
               		  (Old Floorplan) the exact X-Y co-ordinate of all materials in the images are
               		  important -- the placement is mathematical or, as a mathematician might express
               		  it, <i>cartesian</i> -- best thought of in terms of mathematical dimensions and
               		  co-ordinates..
            </li>
            <li><i>Topological</i>: for the other two (Vico Frontispiece) and
               		  (Benardete's commentary) the actual X-Y co-ordinate does not really matter so
               		  much and their placment is not the result of a mathematical process -- in both
               		  cases if the objects in the figures were somewhat differently shaped, or
               		  somewhat differently arrayed on the image it wouldn't really matter so
               		  much.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>So, let's group them together in this way. We could create two notes for
         		these two categories called "Cartesian" and "Topological" and provide
         		references to them on our <i>uses of space for study</i> note and then drag the
         		objects into them -- similar to what we did when grouping materials in the
         		<i>Wittig 1978</i> tutorial (above) to group our annotations into two larger
         		categories. However, let us achieve the same effect more easily by using the
         		context-menu's "group objects" command instead. To do this we select the
         		<i>Simweb</i> and <i>Floorplan</i> references, which belong together in one
         		group, invoke the context menu by then clicking on the other mouse button, and
         		then we choose "Group Objects". If we do this again for the other pair (<i>Vico
            		Frontispiece</i> and <i>Benardete's commentary</i>) the result is:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/organise-tut-7.png"></p>
      <p>Now we can change the names to reflect the two categories of uses that
         		interest us. To change the name double-click on each name in turn and type in
         		the new one:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/organise-tut-8.gif"></p>
      <p>Now, we want to add some commentary to these two ("Cartesian" and
         		"Topological") categories, and to the overall grouping. To do this we decide to
         		minimise all the references to the images, and to reorder the position of the
         		Cartesian and Topological groupings in the reference space so that there is
         		room to put commentary notes in each of them. Then we create the three addition
         		commentary notes to record something we think about our Cartesian and
         		Topological examples:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/organise-tut-9.png"></p>
      <p>Next, we note that our thoughts on the uses of space for study relate
         		somehow to visualization. To record this, we now put a reference to a yet empty
         		note called "visualization" in the reference area (this might be thought of
         		here as a conceptual place-holder). Finally we type some text ("Here we
         		contrast...") into the content area for the "uses..." note. By putting some
         		text there for <i>uses of space for study</i> as well as putting objects in the
         		reference area as we have done up to now we allow any user who sees a reference
         		to this <i>uses of space...</i> object -- whether they are seeing the reference
         		area or only the textual "content" -- to see something, and as a consequence be
         		helped to understand what this object is about.
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/organise-tut-10.png"></p>
      <p>Our new note <i>uses of space for study</i> now contains in itself a 2D
         		representation (and a topological one at that) of some aspects of our thoughts
         		about its subject. Is this 2D representation itself a kind of visualisation?
         		What was the role of the computer in its creation?
      </p>
      <h2>Wrapup</h2>
      <p>One of the interesting things about Pliny is that it allows you to
         		  explore your note and reference collection, and to try out ways to organise
         		  your items into groups representing interesting concepts. The provision of a 2D
         		  space to organise the references allows one to loosely assert relationships
         		  between the materials -- relationships that at a later point you might want to
         		  identify and name.
