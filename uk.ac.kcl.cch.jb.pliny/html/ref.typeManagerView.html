      <h1><a name="d1e5050">2.1.9 Type Manager View</a></h1>
      <h2>What's it for?</h2>
      <p>Reference objects and connections in a reference/annotation area can
         		  each be assigned a <i>type</i> -- the <i>type</i> allows one to assert the kind
         		  of reference or connection it is, and by "kind" we mean the nature of the
         		  relationship between the the two objects that are connected by the reference
         		  object or the connection. The Type Manager View allows you to define what types
         		  you want to have and to associated attributed to these types: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>Name</b>: You can assign a name to the type.
            </li>
            <li><b>Colours</b>: You can assign colours that Pliny is to used
               			 whenever it displays a reference object or connection that is assigned your
               			 type.
            </li>
            <li><b>Roles</b>: You can define roles that the two objects connected
               			 by the reference object or connection should be asserted as having.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>In addition, Pliny maintains a <i>current type</i> which it
         		  automatically assigns to new reference objects and connections when they are
         		  created. With the Type Manager you can set the current type to one of the types
         		  you have defined. Of course although the current type is automatically assigned
         		  to a newly created reference object or connection when it is first created it
         		  can subsequently be changed. To change it after it has been created select the
         		  item you want to change, and then choose "Set Type To..." from the contextual
         		  menu which you request by clicking with the other mouse button.
      </p>
      <h2>Starting the Type Manager View</h2>
      <p>You can ask for the note search view to be displayed by pushing the
         		  Type Manager View icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/typeIcon.gif">) in
         		  Pliny's main toolbar very near the top of Pliny's window:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/types-ref-1.gif"></p>
      <p>Normally the Note Search View will appear at the right end of Pliny's
         		  window:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/types-ref-2.gif"></p>
      <p>If you don't like having the type manager taking up space at the right
         		  side of Pliny, then you can drag its tab to the left end -- where it will stack
         		  on top of other views already there, or to the top and bottom of the screen
         		  (although it is designed to work best in a portrait- rather than
         		  landscape-oriented space. You can even drag it outside of Pliny's window
         		  altogether. See the discussion about this in the section "Moving viewpanes out
         		  of the Pliny main window" in the topic <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing
            		  Panes</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>The drop-down button</h3>
      <p>The Type Manager View icon has a drop-down button (<img align="middle" src="images/pull-down.gif">) beside it. Use this as a shortcut way to change
         			 the current type to one of the types you have available. If you click on this
         			 button a menu will appear:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/types-ref-3.gif"></p>
      <p>You will see a list of all the types you have currently available to
         			 you (ordered alphabetically by type name). Your list may well be different from
         			 this (when you first start using Pliny your list will have only two items in
         			 it, for example, since Pliny starts up with only two types defined for you --
         			 any others in the list will have to be ones you have created yourself, or have
         			 brought in through importing items from an import file).
      </p>
      <p>The item in the list you see with the dot to its left is the
         			 <i>current type</i>. Click on one of the items in the list to make it the new
         			 current type. From then on until you change the <i>current type</i> again or
         			 until you close down Pliny, the type you have set will be associated with each
         			 newly created reference object or connection.
      </p>
      <h2>Parts of the Type Manager View</h2>
      <p>The Type Manager view (with its parts labelled) is:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/types-ref-4.gif"></p>
      <p>The parts are: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>Tab</b>: The Type Manager View's tab always contains the text
               			 "Type Manager".
            </li>
            <li><b>New Type Icon</b>: Click on the New Type Icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/typeIcon.gif">top right side of the view's pane) to request
               			 that a new Type to be created. The New Type Wizard will begin to guide you
               			 through the process of specifying a name, colours and roles. See the Commands
               			 section for more details.
            </li>
            <li><b>List of Types</b>: The main part of the view is a table area
               			 where all the types Pliny currently has avialable is shown -- one type per row.
               			 There are three columns in the table: 
               			 
               <ul>
                  <li><b>Current Type</b>: The left column will indicate which type
                     				  is the current type. The current type has the icon
                     				  <img align="middle" src="images/icons/typeIcon.gif"> in it.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Type Colours</b>: There are 4 colours associated with a
                     				  type, the icon-like image shown here combines two of them: the header colours
                     				  (the ones used in the head area of a reference object, or for the connection
                     				  line).
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Type Name</b>: The name of the type is shown here. You can
                     				  click on the name and then type to change it.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Commands</h2>
      <p>One can interact with the Type Manager in several ways: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>by means of the Icon on the toolbar,</li>
            <li>by means of the contextual menu,</li>
            <li>and by means of menu commands and keyboard shortcuts,</li>
         </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>Drag and Drop operations into or out of the Type Manager and direct
         		  editing are not supported.
      </p>
      <h3>Toolbar</h3>
      <p>There is only one icon on the Type Manager's menu:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/types-ref-5.gif"></p>
      <p>Click on it when you wish to create a new type. It invokes the Type
         			 Wizard to allow you to provide a name, set colours for it, etc. See the <i>Type
            			 Wizard</i> section below for details.
      </p>
      <h3>Contextual Menu</h3>
      <p>Invoke the contextual menu by clicking on a type in the list with
         			 the other mouse button, or on one-button Macintosh holding down the Ctrl key
         			 while clicking. The contextual menu is generated that connects with the
         			 selected type in the Type Manager:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/types-ref-6.gif"></p>
      <p>The commands are: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>Make '<i>&lt;type&gt;</i>' Current</b>: make the chosen item
               				the current type-- the type that will be used whenever any new reference object
               				or connection line is drawn in a reference or annotation area.
            </li>
            <li><b>Edit attributes of <i>'&lt;type&gt;</i>'</b>: click here to
               				invoke the Type Wizard on the current type. The wizard will then allow you to
               				change the attributes (colours, name, etc) attached to the selected type. See
               				the section on the <i>Type Wizard</i> below for details.
            </li>
            <li><b>Delete '<i>&lt;type&gt;</i>'</b>: click here to delete a type.
               				Pliny will check to see if the type you are trying to delete is currently
               				attached to any reference objects or connection lines. If it is Pliny will ask
               				you to choose a type to be assigned as a replacement. You can also then cancel
               				request to delete.
            </li>
            <li>Create a new type: This option is not related to the current
               				type. It works exactly like the "make new type" icon in the toolbar and allows
               				you to create a new type. It invokes the Type Wizard -- see the section about
               				it below for details.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Menubar and Keyboard Operations</h3>
      <p>Only two menubar/keyboard operations are supported: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><b>Delete</b>: deleting a type may be requested either from
               				Edit/Delete or by pressing the Delete key while a type is selected. Pliny will
               				check to see if the type you are trying to delete is currently attached to any
               				reference objects or connection lines. If it is Pliny will ask you to choose a
               				type to be assigned as a replacement. You can also then cancel request to
               				delete.
            </li>
            <li><b>Double-Click</b>: a double-click on any type makes it the
               				current type -- the type that will be used whenever any new reference object or
               				connection line is drawn in a reference or annotation area.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>The Type Wizard</h3>
      <p>The Type Wizard is invoked when you are creating a new type or
         			 changing the attribute of an existing one. It is the place where you can
         			 specify: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>The type's name</li>
            <li>The colours associated with the type</li>
            <li>The Roles associated with the type. Roles are involved when one
               				exports data from Pliny into a Topic Map.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>There are two screens associated wtih the Type Wizard. The first
         			 screen looks like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/types-ref-7.gif"></p>
      <p>The colours section probably requires more explanation. Associated
         			 with a type are two sets of colours -- four colours in all. The first set is
         			 used to display the <i>title area</i> in a reference object and the colour
         			 associated with a collection line. The second set is used to display the
         			 <i>content/body</i> of a reference object:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/types-ref-9.gif"></p>
      <p>In both cases there are two colours involved -- the colour to
         			 display the <i>text</i> and the colour to display the <i>background</i>. In our
         			 example, then, the four colours are: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>Title text: the colour of the title text is white.</li>
            <li>Title backgound: the colour of the title background is dark
               				orange
            </li>
            <li>Body text: the colour of the body text is black</li>
            <li>Body background: the colour of the body background is light
               				orange.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>There are, then, four buttons to select colours -- two to the right
         			 of the <i>Title Colours</i> area, and two to the right of the <i>Body
            			 Colours</i> area. Click on one of them to specify the appropriate colour. You
         			 will get, as a response, the standard colour selection tool provided by your
         			 operating system and can use it to change the colour as you wish.
      </p>
      <p>There is also a <i>Contrast Text</i> button: use it to ask Pliny to
         			 choose a contrasting colour for the background colour. I have found, however,
         			 that Pliny has even worse colour sense than I do -- so you will probably find
         			 that after you have asked Pliny to choose the text colour for you that you will
         			 then want to go and do it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>If you only wish to provide a name and colours for your type, click
         			 on the <i>Finish</i> button to close the wizard. However, there is a second
         			 screen for information about the current type, but it is only relevant if you
         			 plan to export your data into a Topic Map. If you plan to do this you probably
         			 don't need to be told what a Topic Map is! However, if you are reading here
         			 about Pliny you may not know what a Topic Map is (indeed, don't have to know to
         			 use Pliny in a way that will be helpful to you). For those who don't know,
         			 however, a Topic Map is an ISO standard that Google describes as "an ISO
         			 standard for describing knowledge structures and associating them with
         			 information resources". We will not discuss them in any more detail here, but
         			 there is an excellent introduction to the base concepts behind topic maps at
         			 Steve Popper's <a href="http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html">the TAO of Topic
            			 Maps</a>).
      </p>
      <p> Pliny allows you to export your Pliny materials as a topic map (see
         			 the brief discussion about this in the section "Exporting and Importing Data"
         			 in the reference section to the <a href="ref.resourceExplorer.html">Resource
            			 Explorer</a>). If you wish to do this you may wish to manage how Pliny's
         			 generated Topic Map expresses roles associated with your Pliny types. This is
         			 the purpose of the Topic Map wizard's second screen, and you can see it by
         			 clicking on the <i>Next</i> button while looking at the wizard's first screen.
         			 It looks like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/types-ref-8.gif"></p>
      <p>Both references and connection lines are exported by Pliny into a
         			 <i>topic map</i> as an <i>association</i> -- used here as a technical <i>topic
            			 map</i> term meaning an element that relates two topics together. Topics in an
         			 association usually take on roles in the assocation that specify the nature of
         			 the relationship between the topics that participate in the topic. If, for
         			 example, a topic map about people recorded geneological relationships, then one
         			 of the assocations between person topics would be "parent/child", and the two
         			 obvious roles it would have is "who are the parents" and "who is the child".
         			 You can use this second screen in the wizard to specify roles that you want to
         			 be provided in your exported Topic Map.
      </p>
      <p>Note that the screen shows two almost identical parts, one for the
         			 source and one for the target. 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>For a reference object, the source is the containing object. If
               				our Vico Frontispiece resource contains a note describing one of the objects in
               				the frontispeice image, then the source is the Vico Frontispiece resource
               				itself;
            </li>
            <li>for a reference object, the target is the contained object.
               				Continuing our example just mentioned, the note describing the object is the
               				target;
            </li>
            <li>for a connection line: the starting end of the line is the
               				source; and
            </li>
            <li>for a connection line: the ending end of the line is the
               				target.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Let us now focus for the moment on the Source half of the 2nd wizard
         			 screen (the target part is almost exactly the same): 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>There is a radio button in front of <i>Invent Role Name of "~
                  				Source"</i>: When this is chosen Pliny will create a topic and give it a name
               				by taking the name of the type and attaching "<tt> Source</tt>" to the end, and
               				will then use this created topic as the source role.
            </li>
            <li>If the radio button in front of <i>Use chosen resource for the
                  				Target role</i>:is clicked, then you must specify Pliny resource (usually a
               				note) which is to act as the role for your source. Then the remaining areas of
               				the Source section will become active: 
               				
               <ul>
                  <li>Type the name of the resource you want to designate as the
                     					 role source in the one-line field immediately below the <i>Use chosen
                        					 resource...</i> label. As you type the scrolling area below will fill with
                     					 existing Pliny resources whose names begin with the letters you have typed so
                     					 far. If you see in the list of existing resources the resource you wish to use
                     					 as the source role specification, choose it from the bottom area to say "this
                     					 is the resource I want to specify".
                  </li>
                  <li>If no resource turns up in the bottom, you can ask Pliny to
                     					 create a new Pliny note for you, using as its name the name you have typed in
                     					 so far. If you wish this to happen make sure the <i>New?</i> box is
                     					 ticked.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The target half of the wizard page operates in the same way as the
         			 source part except that you use it to specify an item that is to take on the
         			 role for targets attached to this type.
      </p>
      <h2>Using the Type manager as a "type palette"</h2>
      <p>The type manager can be used as a kind of type palette to easily
         		  assign references to Pliny items to a type. See the Section <i>Managing types
            		  by dragging and dropping them from the Type Manager</i> in
         		  <a href="ref.subComponents.html">Pliny SubComponents</a> for details.
