      <h1><a name="d1e4658">2.1.7 Containment View</a></h1>
      <h2>What's it for?</h2>
      <p>When a reference to a resource ("A") (say, a note) appears in another
         		  resource's ("B") reference or annotation area, the reference to B is said to be
         		  contained within A. Containment provides one of the major ways to organise
         		  materials in Pliny. Containment in Pliny does not, however, operate in a
         		  hierarchical structure: it is both true that any note "A" can contain
         		  references to more than one other note, but it is also true that references to
         		  A can appear in many other notes. The <i>Containment View</i> offers a
         		  visualisation of these containments so that you can manage them better.
      </p>
      <h2>Starting the Containment View</h2>
      <p>The Containment View is opened by clicking on its icon in the main
         		  toolbar very near the very top of the Pliny window:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/contain-ref-1.gif"></p>
      <p>In response, the containment view will appear, and will normally place
         		  itself across the bottom edge of the Pliny window. If you'd rather have it
         		  somewhere else, drag it by the tab to one of the edges of the Pliny window (or
         		  right out of the Pliny window if you'd rather have it appear in an independant
         		  window). The containment view tends to be wider rather than tall, so it is
         		  often best to place it at the bottom or top of the Pliny screen rather than to
         		  the sides.
      </p>
      <h2>What the Containment View Shows</h2>
      <p>The containment view tracks the Pliny resource you are showing in the
         		  main editor window, and shows the containment structure associated withat that
         		  resource. As you switch from resource to resource in the main editor window the
         		  containment view will also recreate itself, showing you the structure of each
         		  resource you look at in turn.
      </p>
      <p>The Containment View maps the containment information information
         		  attached to a resource (what references to other resources it contains, and
         		  what other resources contain reference to it) as a graph. When you first
         		  display the Containment View with a note such as:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/contain-ref-2.png"></p>
      <p>... (a note which, itself, is referenced from two other notes) the
         		  Containment view might appear as:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/contain-ref-3.gif"></p>
      <p>Each box represents a resource, the arrows between them show the
         		  containment information. For example, we can see from the Note editor
         		  screenshot above that <i>Wittig 1978</i> contains directly a reference to two
         		  resources. You can see them shown in the containment view with arrows going
         		  from Wittig 1978 to each of them. The direction of the arrow shows the
         		  containment -- it shows that the reference to "Wittig 1978: reading and
         		  semiotics" is contained <i>within</i> "Wittig 1978", for example. The colour of
         		  the arrowhead is the same as the colour of the reference object in the note,
         		  and is controlled by the type associated with the reference itself. There is
         		  more information about reference types and how to manage them in the reference
         		  section for the <a href="ref.typeManagerView.html">Type Manager</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, if we look above the box representing <i>Wittig 1978</i> in
         		  the view we can see the two resources that contain references to Wittig 1978 --
         		  here they are shown as one called <i>Articles on CBTA</i>, and one called
         		  <i>Read Materials</i>.
      </p>
      <p>The containment manager can be asked to show the next level of
         		  containment around its primary resource as well. If we ask this of it (see the
         		  Commands section below for guidance about how this is done) we will see:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/contain-ref-4.gif"></p>
      <p>We have asked the view to show us the next level of containment under
         		  <i>Wittig 1978</i>. We can now see what the original note in the note editor
         		  also happened to show -- that the objects directly contained in <i>Wittig
            		  1978</i> also contain references to other objects themselves. Suppose we now
         		  ask to see the objects contained in <i>Read Materials</i> (above <i>Wittig
            		  1978</i> in this diagram) to see what other objects it refers to as well as
         		  <i>Wittig 1978</i>:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/contain-ref-5.gif"></p>
      <p>The graph is becoming more complex, but we can still see both
         		  <i>Wittig 1978</i> and the objects it contains, and the two objects that
         		  contain references to <i>Wittig 1978</i>. In addition, we can see that Read
         		  Materials contains references to 5 other objects in addition to <i>Wittig
            		  1978</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Hopefully, this bit of information gives you a sense of how the
         		  Containment View operates, and how it might be useful to you. Note that
         		  although you can expand containment levels shown in the view, Pliny will not
         		  store the expansion for future reference -- if you close the Containment View
         		  and reopen it, or if you shut down Pliny altogether and restart it, you will
         		  find that the Containment View will start off showing only the current
         		  reference and the things that directly contain it, and that it directly
         		  contains.
      </p>
      <h2>Commands</h2>
      <p>Pliny's containment view is a display only -- you cannot use it to
         		  actually change any containment information that Pliny is storing for you.
         		  Thus, the commands that the containment view provides can only control what the
         		  view shows you -- not the information behind it.
      </p>
      <h3>Selection</h3>
      <p>Each box in the containment view represents a Pliny resource. To
         			 invoke most of the Pliny commands (but not all of them) you must select one or
         			 more of them. Select a resource by clicking on its display box. If you wish to
         			 select more than one, hold down the Shift key while clicking on the 2nd and
         			 third one. As you select Pliny will show you which one(s) has/have been
         			 selected by drawing a heavier box about it. Here is a fragment of the display
         			 with one item selected showing it:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/contain-ref-6.gif"></p>
      <p>Item <i>Articles on CBTA</i> is currently selected, whereas
         			 <i>Wittig 1978</i> is not.
      </p>
      <h3>Operations on Selected Objects</h3>
      <p>Once you have selected one or more objects you can request some
         			 operations to be performed on them. You do this by displaying the contextual
         			 menu (by clicking with the other mouse button (or, on the one-button Macintosh,
         			 clicking while the CTRL button is depressed) while the mouse pointer still
         			 points at one of your selected items. The contextual menu will look like
         			 this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/contain-ref-7.gif"></p>
      <p>All the commands except for the last ("Included Types") will be
         			 applied to the currently selected items. Choose a command from the list by
         			 pointing at it and clicking. We will describe "Included Types" shortly. Here is
         			 a description of the other operations: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li><tt>Open Selected</tt>: Choose this to ask Pliny to open its
               				editor for the selected items. Here, if only <i>Articles on CBTA</i> was
               				selected, choosing this command would cause Plinyh to open the Note Editor on
               				<i>Articles on CBTA</i>.
            </li>
            <li><tt>Add Containment Parents</tt>: Choose this to ask Pliny to
               				extend the current Containment View to show all the references that contain
               				references to the selected items. Here, if only <i>Articles on CBTA</i> is
               				selected, then Pliny will show all places containing a reference to <i>Articles
                  				to CBTA</i>. Select several items before choosing this item to have it applied
               				against several items at once.
            </li>
            <li><tt>Add Containment Children</tt>: Choose this to ask Pliny to
               				extend the current Containment View to show all the references that are made by
               				the selected items. Here, if only <i>Articles on CBTA</i> is selected, then
               				Pliny will show all places <i>Articles to CBTA</i> refers to. Select several
               				items before choosing this item to have it applied against several items at
               				once.
            </li>
            <li><tt>Add Parents and Children</tt>: Choose this to ask Pliny to
               				request both parents and children to be added at the same time. Here, if only
               				<i>Articles on CBTA</i> is selected, then Pliny will show all places
               				<i>Articles to CBTA</i> refers to, and all places that refer to <i>Articles to
                  				CBTA</i>. Select several items before choosing this item to have it applied
               				against several items at once.
            </li>
            <li><tt>Included types</tt>: choose this to filter the references
               				shown in the containment view by the reference type. See the subsection
               				immediately below this for more details.
            </li>
            <li><tt>Export Data</tt>: (shown only if more than one item is chosen
               				in this this display) Choose this item to ask Pliny to take the items you have
               				selected in the containment display and export them to a text file (in
               				HTML).
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Included Types List</h3>
      <p>The Containment View shows containment references between objects
         			 but is configured by default to suppress references of type "source document".
         			 You might recall that source document references are automatically inserted as
         			 back references when referent support is in use. They are used to assert that
         a
         			 particular note comes from a particular source, and since they are pointers
         			 back from the point of view of the Containment View they often provide
         			 redundant information that makes the containment diagram unnecessarily
         			 complex.
      </p>
      <p>Choose the Included Types List if you wish to change these
         			 assumptions. You will see a further list of types that you have in Pliny and by
         			 choosing items representing the types in the list you can choose to ask the
         			 Containment View to ignore or include all references that are of any of these
         			 types. Unless you have already changed the types selection you will see that
         			 references of type source document will be excluded and all others are
         			 included. If you change this setting Pliny will remember your new setting both
         			 for the rest of this session and for future Pliny sessions as well until you
         			 change it again.
