      <h1><a name="d1e2974">2.1 Annotation Tools and Views</a></h1>
      <p>Pliny has a set of components that support annotation, notetaking and
         		organisation of notes. These tools divide into two broad groups (defined for
         		Pliny by the Eclipse framework in which it is built): 
         	 
         <ul>
            <li><b>Editors</b>: In Pliny, all the eclipse editor objects are
               		  annotation tools. All active instances of these annotation tool/editors appear
               		  in the Eclipse editor pane which usually takes up a central area on the Pliny
               		  window. There can be only one editor pane. It is possible to install additional
               		  tools into Pliny (not described here), but "out of the box" Pliny's Editor
               		  objects are: 
               		  
               <ul>
                  <li>Pliny's <a href="ref.webBrowser.html">Web Browser</a> container
                     				displays a web browser and allows you to attach notes to any page it
                     				displays.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <a href="ref.noteEditor.html">Note Editor</a> provides a place
                     				to edit a note, and link it to other notes.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <a href="ref.pdfAnnotator.html">PDF Annotator</a> provides a
                     				place for annotating PDF (Acrobat) files.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <a href="ref.imageAnnotator.html">Image Annotator</a> provides
                     				a place where digital images can be annotated.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Views</b>: Views provide tools to assist you in managing your use
               		  of Pliny -- think of them as supporting the name annotation, notetaking, note
               		  organising task that occurs with the annotation tools listed above. Views sit
               		  in one or more view panes (they cannot be mixed in with editors in the same
               		  pane). Although only one instance of a view can be open at a time, there can be
               		  more than one pane open with views in it. Often view panes are laid out around
               		  the central editor pane. For example, Pliny's Resource Explorer is a
               		  <i>view</i> and is (initially at least) placed to appear in a pane to the right
               		  of the main editor pane area. Pliny's containment view, however, often works
               		  best in a pane that is the full width of the Pliny/Eclipse window, and when
               		  opened is often placed in a pane across the bottom of the Pliny window. Pliny's
               		  views are: 
               		  
               <ul>
                  <li>The <a href="ref.resourceExplorer.html">Resource Explorer</a>
                     				provides a starting list of all materials you have collected in Pliny,
                     				including all digital objects you have annotated and all the notes you have
                     				created.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <a href="ref.containmentView.html">Containment View</a>
                     				provides a graphical visualisation to help you understand how references to
                     				Pliny resources are contained with each other.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <a href="ref.noteSearchView.html">Note Search View</a> allows
                     				you to search through the words you have put in your notes to find instances
                     				where the word you are asking for appears.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <a href="ref.typeManagerView.html">Type Manager View</a>
                     				allows you to manage Pliny's link types.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <a href="ref.annotationView.html">Annotation View</a> allows
                     				you to associated Pliny's notes with other Eclipse tools that are not aware of
                     				Pliny. This tool is only needed when Pliny is operating inside a larger Eclipe
                     				framework, rather than in the standalone packaging of Pliny, since all the
                     				annotators in Pliny's standalone packaging support integrated annotation
                     				already.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <a href="ref.resourceHolderView.html">Pliny Resource
                        				Holder</a> can be helpful when you want to copy references to Pliny notes or
                     				other resources from one place to another.
