      <h1><a name="d1e5364">2.1.10 Pliny Resource Holder view</a></h1>
      <h2>What is it for?</h2>
      <p>During the times that you are working on organising your annotations
         		  and notes you will find that you will want to copy a note from one place to
         		  another. You can do in various ways without the Resource Holder View, but often
         		  none are particularly comfortable to manage. Pliny's Resource Holder view helps
         		  with this by providing a place where you can temporarily hold a reference to an
         		  object. Drag something into the Resource Holder view to place a temporary
         		  reference to it there, then drag it back from the view when you are ready to
         		  place it somewhere.
      </p>
      <h2>Starting the Resource Holder</h2>
      <p>The button to display the Resource Holder is located among the
         		  Resource Explorer's buttons:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/resHolder-ref-1.gif"></p>
      <p>Clicking on it will cause the Resource Holder to display. There is a
         		  problem in the Pliny code that may cause it to appear in the wrong place on the
         		  Pliny screen the first time you launch it. We find it best to place it in the
         		  bottom left corner of the Pliny screen, below the Resource Explorer, like this
         		  (and, indeed, we tried to write the code in Pliny to get it placed there
         		  automatically for you!):
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/resHolder-ref-2.gif"></p>
      <p>If it doesn't appear there, or you wish it to be somewhere else, you
         		  can move it. If you don't know how to move the Resource Holder from where Pliny
         		  first places it to this lower left-hand corner, review the instructions for
         		  this found in section "Arranging Panes on the Screen in <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes</a>. You can even drag it outside of
         		  Pliny's window altogether. See the discussion about this in the section "Moving
         		  viewpanes out of the Pliny main window" in the topic <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Once you place it here (or elsewhere, if you prefer), Pliny will
         		  correctly remember the place, so that if you open it again it will start up
         		  next time back in the location in which it last appeared.
      </p>
      <p>To close the Resource Holder, click on the X beside the Resource
         		  Holder tab.
      </p>
      <h2>Using The Resource Holder</h2>
      <p>The Resource Holder provides a place to temporarily "dock" a Pliny
         		  item. Use it to copy a reference from one place in your Pliny materials to
         		  another. To use the holder, drag a reference to an item to the resource holder
         		  view, and release it (remember, as in all drag and drop operations in Pliny,
         		  you must drag the draggable object attached to the object: for a reference
         		  object, for example, this is the icon in the top left corner).
      </p>
      <p>This figure shows the various places you can drag from, when dragging
         		  items to the Resource Holder:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/resHolder-ref-3.png"></p>
      <p> The holder will display the icon and title for the item that it is
         		  currently holding for you. You can drag more than one item to the resource
         		  holder -- the latest item to be added will always appear at the top:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/resHolder-ref-4.gif"></p>
      <p>When you are ready to place one of the items in the resource holder in
         		  a new place in Pliny, drag the item from the resource holder to the place you
         		  would like to place it. A reference to the item will appear at the destination,
         		  and it will be removed from the Resource Holder list.
      </p>
      <p>The Resource Holder is a way to provide a temporary place to store a
         		  reference only. It is wiped clean each time Pliny is stopped, and so will be
         		  empty next time Pliny is started up again.
      </p>
      <p>That's all there is to it!</p>
