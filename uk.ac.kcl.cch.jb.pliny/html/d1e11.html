      <h1>Pliny</h1>
      <p>Welcome! Pliny is a tool that works with annotations or notes that you
         		gather as you are reading -- arguably the starting point for much personal
         		scholarly research in the humanities. It can be used with both digital (web
         		sites, images and PDF files) and non-digital (books, journal articles)
         		materials. The text of the annotation can be about anything that you wish to
         		record -- indeed, whatever strikes you about the material you are reading is
         		fair game.
      </p>
      <p>Pliny is designed assuming that you will accumulate many notes over
         		time. This leads us to a possible second phase in the use of Pliny, where your
         		note collection provides a base platform upon which you might develop some sort
         		of interpretation of the materials they refer to. To this end, Pliny has
         		components in it that go beyond annotation facilities to help you <i>manage</i>
         		your notes and <i>organise</i> them, even if you have thousands of them to work
         		through. In this way we hope Pliny will help you with the task of taking your
         		reactions to your research materials and transforming them into an overarching
         		scheme or structure into which most or all your notes can fit, and that the
         		structure you express in Pliny will capture some important aspects of the
         		interpretation you have developed.
      </p>
      <p>There are other pieces of software that work with concepts and ideas in
         		ways that are similar to Pliny, but they are not widely known, and we assume
         		here that you are not familiar with them. Because what Pliny does is quite
         		different from what software you <i>are</i> familiar with does (it is not a web
         		browser, it is not a word processor, it is not an email program, etc.), you may
         		find that you will have to work a bit to understand Pliny and to see what it
         		can do for you. For this reason we provide here more than just reference
         		material that is meant to remind you how to do things you already do with other
         		programs. We also preface this with a large section that introduces you to
         		Pliny in general. The documentation, then, breaks into two divisions: 
         	 
         <ul>
            <li>The section "<a href="getting.started.html">Getting Started with
                  		  Pliny</a>" introduces you to the Eclipse environment in which Pliny operates,
               		  and provides some <a href="tut.tutorialIndex.html">tutorials</a> that will help
               		  you start using Pliny to support your own work. If you are unfamiliar with
               		  software that does the kind of things that Pliny does for you, we suggest that
               		  you at least read through one or two of these before beginning to work with
               		  Pliny.
            </li>
            <li>The section "<a href="ref.html">Pliny Reference</a>" provides a
               		  somewhat more formal description of the components that make up Pliny's user
               		  interface.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Pliny works on the Macintosh, but it looks a little different from how
         		it looks under Windows. There is a little about the differences at
         		<a href="intro.macintosh.html">Pliny on the Macintosh</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>The Pliny project on the WWW</h2>
      <p>The Pliny project website can be found at
         		  <a href="http://pliny.cch.kcl.ac.uk"><tt>http://pliny.cch.kcl.ac.uk</tt></a>. Go there to find out about updates to
         		  Pliny and other information about it, including any current news about the
         		  Pliny project. There are also some articles (listed near the end of webpage
         		  <a href="http://pliny.cch.kcl.ac.uk/whatIsPliny.html"><tt>http://pliny.cch.kcl.ac.uk/whatIsPliny.html</tt></a>) that provide you
         		  with an overview of what Pliny is about.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, the Pliny program is open-source, and is designed the way
         		  it is to facilitate collaboration between tool builders and the tools they
         		  build. If you are a tool builder for the Humanities, you might be interested in
         		  some of the information provided in the
         		  <a href="http://pliny.cch.kcl.ac.uk/dev/index.html">developers section</a> of
         		  the project website as well.
