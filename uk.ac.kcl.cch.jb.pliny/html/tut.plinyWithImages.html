      <h1><a name="d1e2211">1.2.3 Using Pliny with Images</a></h1>
      <p>So far in these tutorials we have seen how to use the imbedded web
         		browser and the note editor as a place to attach personal notes. With the image
         		and PDF annotation tool, however, we move from linking notes in a general way
         		to another resource (via a note or web-page's <i>reference area</i>) to
         		attaching a note to a <i>specific location</i> in a resource. We distinguish
         		this from note taking by calling this process <i>annotation</i>. Both Pliny's
         		image and PDF annotation tools allow a resource can be attached to <i>a
            		specific 2D area</i> on an image or on a page in a PDF file.
      </p>
      <h2>Importing Images</h2>
      <p>To use the image annotation editor in Pliny on an image one must first
         		  associate the tool with the image you wish to annotate -- the image becomes a
         		  Pliny <i>resource</i>, and the process is called "importing an image into
         		  Pliny". This task is can be done through any one of three mechanisms: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>If you have located the image in Pliny's embedded web browser, you
               			 can use a tool it provides to set up the image so that it can be annotated. (we
               			 will discuss this method in more detail in just a moment)
            </li>
            <li>If you have located the image in another web browser you can use
               			 drag and drop facilities provided within the Resource Explorer to import the
               			 image.
            </li>
            <li>If you have the image on your own computer you can also use the
               			 Resource Explorer's drag and drop facilities to import the image for
               			 annotation.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>In all three cases a copy of the image will be cached in Pliny's data
         		  storage area for its internal use, so it will not matter to Pliny whether the
         		  image continues to be where it was imported from or not.
      </p>
      <p>We describe these three alternatives below.</p>
      <h3>Setting up the Image from the Embedded Browser</h3>
      <p>Suppose you have located a web page in Pliny's imbedded browser that
         			 contains an image that you wish to annotate. Here is such an image (well, the
         			 top of it anyway!), from the <i>Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and
            			 Ireland</i> (<a href="http://www.crsbi.ac.uk"><tt>http://www.crsbi.ac.uk</tt></a>): 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-1.png"></p>
      <p>It shows a capital of a column in the church of St. Michael in
         			 Blewbury, Berkshire.
      </p>
      <p>To load the image into Pliny locate the "Make into Image" button in
         			 the browser's control panel (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/imageIcon.gif">) and
         			 press it. This invokes Pliny's image importing process which takes the HTML
         			 page currently displayed by the browser, processes it to locate appropriate
         			 image or images on the page, and sets it/them up as one or more image
         			 resources. See the subsection below <i>What the importer does</i> in this
         			 tutorial to find out what happens in more detail.
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes, as in this case, Pliny finds more than one image that
         			 might be a candidate for importing on a particular web page. If so, Pliny will
         			 create a dialog box which lists the possible images and allows you to choose
         			 the one or ones you wish to import. Here is the dialog box Pliny shows us for
         			 the web page showing above:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-1a.png"></p>
      <p>Pliny shows us two images as thumbnails. Obviously (to us!) the
         			 first one is the one we want to import. Choose the first one by clicking in its
         			 selection box and click on the OK button. If there had been more than one image
         			 from a web page that you want to import you can simply choose more than
         			 one.
      </p>
      <h3>Setting up the Image from another web Browser</h3>
      <p>If you find an image of interest in a web browser outside of Pliny
         			 you can use drag and drop action to load the image from there into Pliny as
         			 well. The following diagram illustrates the process:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-2.png"></p>
      <p>In your web browser locate the Location Bar which will be showing
         			 you the URL of the page you are currently viewing. The illustration shows the
         			 location bars as they appear in Internet Explorer and FireFox. To the left of
         			 the URL you will see an icon (here indicated with a orange box). Point your
         			 mouse pointer at it and drag it until you can drop it on top of the Image
         			 folder in Pliny's Resource Explorer. This act will be interpreted as a request
         			 to Pliny to take the HTML referenced by the URL and load appropriate image(s)
         			 that it finds referenced there into Pliny.
      </p>
      <p>If you prefer, you can ask Pliny to load only a particular image you
         			 found on the web page and ignore the contents of the rest of the page. To do
         			 this, point your mouse pointer at the particular image you wish to load and
         			 then drag it to the Image folder in Pliny's Resource Explorer.
      </p>
      <h3>Setting up the Image from your hard disk</h3>
      <p>You can also import an image that you hold on you machine's own disk
         			 by locating its icon in a folder and dragging that icon to the Image folder in
         			 Pliny's Resource Explorer. 
      </p>
      <h3>What the importer does</h3>
      <p>Dragging and dropping either an image or a URL to an HTML page that
         			 contains an image (as described above) starts up Pliny's image importer. If we
         			 invoked the importer with our example HTML page examples above the importer
         			 will generate a Pliny image resource, and automatically open it for us,
         			 resulting in:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-3.png"></p>
      <p>At first glance the result looks very similar to the original
         			 HTML-driven display. Like the Pliny web browser, Pliny's image annotation tool
         			 has a large area to display the resource (here, an image), and above it is
         			 Pliny's tool bar that contains a set of annotation tools to the right, and the
         			 name of the current resourse in a field close to the top left area. However,
         			 although one can see similiarites between Pliny's web browser, and its
         			 annotation tool, there are also some immediately visible important differences:
         			 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>First, the focus in an Pliny image resource is on the image --
               				not an HTML page containing an image. Just the imported image is visible here,
               				and the header materials that came from the HTML on the web page is no longer
               				above the image, for example.
            </li>
            <li>Second, Pliny has created an Image resource that refers to this
               				image. Like all other resources in Pliny, it has a name, and you can see the
               				name both in the Pliny toolbar near the top of the editing frame: "S nave
               				arcade, bay 2, E capital - The Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture", and in the tab
               				above that. Since the image resource was created from a web page, Pliny took
               				this title of the associated web page and used it as a name for the image
               				resource it was creating too.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, because the focus is on the image and not the HTML page
               				it came from, the importer creates two resources and places references to them
               				on the image display. 
               				
               <ul>
                  <li>The first one (with the green banner) is a note the importer
                     					 creates for you with all the text it found on the HTML page it was given. Pliny
                     					 cannot interpret HTML in a very sophisticated way so the text is relatively
                     					 plain. Often you need to fix it up further, and indeed we shall fix it up
                     					 shortly in this tutorial.
                  </li>
                  <li>The second one (with the blue banner) at is currently sitting
                     					 on top of the green noe is a reference to a web page resource that points to
                     					 the web page. As long as this object is here we can always use it to go back
                     to
                     					 the original web page by opening its attached resource.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>As we shall see shortly, the two references that the importer has
         			 automatically created for us can be removed (by clicking on them to select them
         			 and then pushing the Delete key) if we don't find them useful, or they can be
         			 moved/resized. Furthermore, the first of the two is a note and so its contents
         			 can be altered for our purposes.
      </p>
      <p>Note here that the importer was given a full HTML page that
         			 contained an image -- not just a specific image itself. If the HTML page
         			 contains more than one appropriate image than the importer will create more
         			 than one image resource from that web page. Here, however, the HTML page
         			 contained only one appropriate image so only one image was imported. What is
         			 meant by "appropriate image" here? The main criteria is size. Images are often
         			 used on HTML pages purely for decoration, and generally these images for
         			 decoration are small. Thus, the image importer ignores images smaller than
         			 100x100 pixels in size. If you find that the importer has loaded several images
         			 from a page and you only want one the easiest solution is to simply use the
         			 Resource Explorer to locate and delete the unwanted ones.
      </p>
      <h2>Fixing up the newly-loaded Image Resources</h2>
      <p>Now that we have an image resource we might well want to fix up what
         		  the image importer has created for us: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>First, we'll move the two resource references the importer created
               			 for us so that they are sitting above the picture rather than over it. Point
               			 the mouse pointer at each title in turn and drag it to the top of space, above
               			 the image.
            </li>
            <li>Second, we'll alter the text of the note (in green) the importer
               			 created so that it better describes the source of the image. Its content is
               			 derived from the CRSBI web page, and contains some useful information, but also
               			 a large amount of text for navigation buttons such as "Home" and "Search". We
               			 can edit the content by double-clicking on the context to open it as a "direct
               			 edit", and then we can change it as we like.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, we change the name of the image resource itself to
               			 something a little shorter and perhaps more meaningful for our purposes. Click
               			 in the name field for the resource near the top of the window in the Pliny
               			 toobar and change it to "CRSBI: St Michael, Blewbury, Berkshire".
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>This results in:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-4.png"></p>
      <p>It is important to understand that the importer has created three
         		  different resources for us: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>The main resource is the image resource that represents the image
               			 itself -- the one we will begin to annotate shortly. We see it in the above
               			 figure in an <i>image annotation pane</i>. Note the image icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/imageIcon.gif">) in the tab area above the Pliny image
               			 annotator pane, which indicates that it is an image resource.
            </li>
            <li>The importer has also created a web page resource that refers to
               			 the the source of the image. We can see it through the blue reference the
               			 importer has put on the page for us -- it has the WWW icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/browserIcon.gif">) in its top left corner to indicate that
               			 it is a reference to a web page.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, the importer created a note in which it put the text of
               			 the HTML page it was reading at the time of the import. We have just edited it
               			 down so that it describes the object in the church from which the image was
               			 taken. It appears here in green and it's type icon is the Note icon:
               			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"></li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Although the importer has created three resources for us, and provided
         		  them initially all with the same name -- derived from the HTML title -- they
         		  are actually three separate resources. We just changed the name of the image
         		  resource itself, but we can also change the name of the other two as well as we
         		  see fit.
      </p>
      <h2>Adding an Annotation</h2>
      <p>Suppose we wish to note the use of a leaf motif in the carving on the
         		  capital. With the image annotator we can create an annotation to do this. An
         		  annotation in Pliny contains three parts: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>An <i>anchor</i>: a link to a part of the object being annotated.
               			 Since we are here annoting an image, the link will be an area on the
               			 image.
            </li>
            <li>A <i>note</i> containing the text of the annotation.
            </li>
            <li>A <i>line</i> that connects the anchor to its note.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>To create the annotation we first must click on the Annotation button
         		  in the toolbar:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-5.png"></p>
      <p>Alternatively, we could push the F7 key which acts as a keyboard
         		  shortcut to the <i>Create Annotation</i> action. Having clicked on this icon to
         		  indicate that we wish to create an annotation we use the mouse to drag out over
         		  the area where we wish the anchor to appear:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-6.png"></p>
      <p>.. and then release the mouse button when we have defined the area
         		  where the anchor is to go. As a result, Pliny will create (i) the anchor where
         		  we have requested it, (ii) an empty note, and (iii) a line that connects
         		  them:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-7.png"></p>
      <p>Pliny has placed a anchor area, link, and note on the image. We now
         		  have some fixups to do: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>First, should move the location of the note off to the side of the
               			 image and perhaps shrink the size of the note itself so that it does not
               			 obstruct so much of the image. As we have described in previous tutorials, you
               			 can move the note by pointing at the note's title bar and dragging it with the
               			 ouse. You can resize it by clicking on the note to select it and then drag the
               			 handles that appear to the new size. As we move the note reference object to
               			 the side of the image itself the line connecting to the note to the anchor
               			 stays connected. Pliny knows that the line is a connector between the note and
               			 the anchor and will ensure that it remains attached.
            </li>
            <li>Having placed the note in a better place, we can change the title
               			 of the note Pliny has just created for us to "Leaf Motif", and
            </li>
            <li>then we should add the text of our note into its body.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>This results in:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-8.png"></p>
      <p>We have moved the note part of the annotation -- but the anchor part
         		  is also resizable and moveable if needbe. So, if we didn't get it placed
         		  exactly right, we can fix that.
      </p>
      <h2>Annotations, Notes, Connections and Anchors</h2>
      <p>We have described an annotation as consisting of a note, an anchor and
         		  a connection between them. Although there is a single button that can be pushed
         		  to create an annotations 3 components in one go, the three pieces can be
         		  separated created as well through buttons on the image annotator's annotation
         		  area toolbar: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><i>Note Button</i> (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">):
               			 The note button can be used to tell Pliny that you wish to create a note. After
               			 pushing the button drag out the area where you wish the note to appear.
               			 (Keyboard shortcut: F5)
            </li>
            <li><i>Connection Button</i> (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">): The connection button is used to tell
               			 Pliny you want to connect a note and/or anchor with another note/anchor via a
               			 line. After clicking on it drag from the source note/anchor to the target/note
               			 anchor to indicate what two objects are to be connected. (Keyboard shortcut:
               			 F6)
            </li>
            <li><i>Annotation Button</i> (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/annotationIcon.gif">): The annotation button, then, simply
               			 acts as a short-cut way to create an anchor and a note connected by a
               			 connection line. (Keyboard shortcut: F7)
            </li>
            <li><i>Anchor Button</i> (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/anchorIcon.gif">): The anchor button is used to tell Pliny
               			 you wish to define an anchor area. After pushing the anchor button drag out the
               			 area where you wish the anchor (a coloured box) to appear. (Keyboard shortcut:
               			 F8)
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>There is no restriction to an annotation having only one note, one
         		  anchor and one connection. You can draw more than one connection line between
         		  either multiple anchors from one note or multiple notes to one anchor if that
         		  is useful. You can delete any connection if you wish by selecting it and
         		  pushing the Delete key.
      </p>
      <p>Notes can also appear that are not anchored to any part of the figure.
         		  Suppose, for example, that we wish to add a further note to this image that
         		  quotes a bit of CRSBI's web page discussion of these columns. To do so we click
         		  on the Note button, drag out where we want the note to appear on the image, and
         		  then edit the note contents and title:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-9.png"></p>
      <p>You can add as many anchors, notes and connections as you need for
         		  your purposes, of course.
      </p>
      <h2>Image Resources and the Resource Explorer</h2>
      <p>In this tutorial we have only created one image resource, but one is
         		  enough to allow us to examine how image resources are handled in the Resource
         		  Explorer:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-10.gif"></p>
      <p>Note that the Image folder is the place where all image resources are
         		  stored. If we open the Image folder we see the "C" folder. Image resources are
         		  organised by the Resource Explorer by the first letter of their name (the same
         		  as we have seen for Notes and Web pages) -- and the single image resource we
         		  currently have has a name that starts with "C". When we open the "C" folder we
         		  see the single resource, with its idenifying icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/imageIcon.gif">). If we open this we see the same two groups
         		  we saw within a note: <i>Displayed in</i> shows all the other resources that
         		  have a reference to this image resource (currently there are none, so this is
         		  empty), and <i>Contains</i> which shows what resources are contained in this
         		  image. Inside the "Contains" item is the list of notes and other resources that
         		  appear "on" the image. We can see here the three notes we have currently on the
         		  image, and the one reference to the web page resource which also appears
         		  there.
      </p>
      <p>You can use the image object in the Resource Explorer in three ways: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>You can <i>delete</i> the image (and its associated references) by
               			 pointing at the resource you want to delete so that you select it, and then
               			 either push the delete key or choose "Delete" from the "Edit" menu.
            </li>
            <li>You can <i>open</i> the image resource if it is not currently open
               			 by double-clicking on the item.
            </li>
            <li>You can <i>edit</i> the image resource's name by clicking on the
               			 name to open it, and then editing its text until you have the name you
               			 wish.
            </li>
            <li>You can delete a reference within this image's annotation area by
               			 selecting it from among the items displayed in the <i>Contains</i> list and
               			 pushing the Delete key. Note that this deletes the <i>reference</i>, not the
               			 underlying object itself.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Managing a number of Image Resources</h2>
      <p>The Resource Explorer will always provide you with a reference to all
         		  the image resources your version of Pliny currently holds, but they will be
         		  filed by their name. As the number of image resources gets large you may want
         		  to keep track of them in other ways. Suppose, for example, you want to file the
         		  images, and group them by the kind of image -- say, grouping all the
         		  architectual images together. In Pliny one does this by creating an object
         		  (usually a note) that contains images you want to reference. Furthermore, any
         		  of these reference notes can appear as a Pliny bookmark so that they can be
         		  quickly accessible.In this part of the tutorial we will begin to build such a
         		  structure. The process is almost the same as that used to create the "My
         		  Readings" note in the previous tutorial.
      </p>
      <h3>Creating "My Images" Bookmark note</h3>
      <p>We begin by using the Note button in the Resource Explorer (be sure
         			 you click on the right "New Note" icon -- there are probably several "Note"
         			 icons on your Pliny screen and you want the one in the Resource Explorer pane!)
         			 to create a new note called "My Images", and at the same time asking for it to
         			 be stored as a bookmark:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-11.gif"></p>
      <p>As a result Pliny will create the new note, and put it a reference
         			 to it in the bookmarks:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-12.png"></p>
      <p>This is the note we will use to hold organise referenes to images in
         			 ways that suit our own interests. We add some content text in the left-hand
         			 content area to this effect, stating that "My Images" is a top level holder for
         			 all images we are using in our current study.
      </p>
      <p>Now, we wish to create a category <i>Architectural</i> which will
         			 hold references to all architectual images we will be collecting. We want to
         			 put our new Archectural container within the My Images reference area, so the
         			 easiest way to achieve this is to on the <i>New Note</i> button in the Note
         			 Editor's tool bar and draw out a new note in "My Images" reference area. We
         			 then change the name of this new note to "Architectural", and add a brief
         			 description of it for the note's textual content:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-13.png"></p>
      <p>Now, we wish to use the <i>Architectural</i> note reference here as
         			 a container for images that we consider architectural. To change the reference
         			 object to its container format we click on the "Map Icon" (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/showMap.gif">) in Architectural's reference object. This
         			 changes the way the reference object appears -- hiding the note's content, but
         			 showing its reference area in its place:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-14.png"></p>
      <p>Now we are ready to file a reference to our image. Locate the item
         			 in the Resource Explorer and drag it into the "Architectural" note's reference
         			 area:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-15.png"></p>
      <p>As a result, a reference to our image will be stored in the
         			 <i>Architectural</i> note within the <i>My Images</i> note. We can see the
         			 reference both in the reference area for <i>My Images</i> and within the
         			 <i>Contains</i> display in the Resource Explorer.
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-16.png"></p>
      <p>Furthermore, we can use either reference (in "My Image" or in the
         			 <i>Resource Explorer</i>) as a way to open the image resource whenever we like
         			 -- by double-clicking on the entry in the Resource Explorer, by double clicking
         			 on the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/imageIcon.gif"> in the reference object
         			 itself, or by choosing "Open Selected" from the context menu in the reference
         			 area while the item we wish to open is selected.
      </p>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
      <p>Pliny supports the creation of image resources which can be annotated.
         		  Image resources can be created from images held on your hard disk, or harvested
         		  from web pages fetched from the WWW. Annotation on an image object combines
         		  note creation with the ability to link to a spot on the image by means of an
         		  anchor. Image resources appear in the Resource Explorer in the Image folder,
         		  but you can create a kind of "master" note to hold, say, all images of a
         		  certain kind, and add this master note to the Pliny bookmarks. In this way, you
         		  can file your images in a way that better suits your particular needs.
