      <h1><a name="d1e706">1.2.1 Using Pliny with Web-based materials</a></h1>
      <p>As you probably know by now, Pliny is in part a tool to assist you in
         		annotation and note taking, and indeed, as you will see later, you can use
         		Pliny to annotate digital resources such as PDF files or web pages. In this
         		tutorial we will demonstrate how you can use Pliny with web-based materials.
         		Pliny has some tools that will help you manage materials you read from the WWW
         		in a useful fashion, and we expect that for most of you the first use of Pliny
         		could well be to work with WWW materials in this way. Think of it as a more
         		sophisticated version of your browser's bookmark or favourites tool.
      </p>
      <p>If you are starting up Pliny for the first time you will find that Pliny
         		has some setting up tasks to do and the startup will take a little longer than
         		usual. Furthermore, if you are using Pliny in its standalone packaging (rather
         		than as a plugin to Eclipse) for the first time you will be shown Pliny's
         		"welcome screen" which points you to materials (like this tutorial) that will
         		help you start using Pliny. Close the welcome screen once you are ready to
         		begin to use Pliny in earnest. When the setup is finished and after you have
         		finished with the welcome screen, Pliny will show you a screen similar to the
         		following: 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/first-screen.gif"></p>
      <p>You have put no data into Pliny yet, so there isn't very much to see
         		here. A general introduction to how Pliny lays out things on the screen can be
         		found in the help section at <a href="getting.started.html">Getting Started with
            		<i>Pliny</i></a> which you might like to consult after you finish reading
         		this tutorial. For now, however, we can make do with a brief introduction. You
         		can see Pliny's menu and tool bars showing in the top area of Pliny's window
         		(on the Macintosh, as you might expect, Pliny's menu appears at the top of the
         		screen instead, in the usual place on a Macintosh for such things). Pliny also
         		divides up the screen into rectangular areas called <i>panes</i>, and when it
         		starts up the first time it divides the main area of its screen below the menu
         		and toolbar into two panes -- a long and narrow left, and a larger right one.
         		Then it places Pliny's <i>Resource Explorer</i> in left one. The larger right
         		pane is left empty (and shows as grey to indicate that it is currently empty).
         		This is the primary area where work is done in Pliny and is called the
         		<i>Editor Pane</i> (borrowing terminology from Eclipse, an environment that
         		forms the basis for Pliny).
      </p>
      <p>Since we are going to use Pliny's embedded web browser, the first step
         		is to get it started.
      </p>
      <h2>Starting the Browser</h2>
      <p> To start the web browser within Pliny you click on the browser icon
         		  in Pliny's main toolbar, which is showing near the top right corner of the
         		  Pliny window:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-1.gif"></p>
      <p>In response the Pliny window will change to this:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-0.gif"></p>
      <p>The grey area which originally represented the empty editor pane has
         		  now gained a tab (containing the text "Pliny: Welcome"). The space immediately
         		  below it in the editor pane has been filled with a toolbar just below the tab,
         		  and then the rest of the area divided into two sections -- to the left is the
         		  area showing the browser area, including the display of a webpage with a set of
         		  browser buttons and a field for the current URL above it. To the right is an
         		  empty white space called the <i>reference area</i> (described in more detail
         		  shortly). To the left of the editor pane we can still see Pliny's Resource
         		  Explorer. The screen snapshot is made rather small so that it's image will fit
         		  well into this help screen. In reality, on your computer the editor pane is
         		  probably wider, and there will be more space to show more of the webpage.
      </p>
      <p>Since this is the first time you have started the browser in Pliny,
         		  the browser will start up showing the default home page for Pliny: the web page
         		  from <tt>pliny.cch.kcl.ac.uk</tt> -- the Pliny project's home page. You can
         		  change the browser's home page if you wish -- see the description of how to do
         		  this in the section <i>Browser Controls</i> in the <a href="ref.webBrowser.html">Web Browser reference section</a>.
      </p>
      <p>You can, of course, change the size of Pliny's window overall in the
         		  way you do this with any program on your computer. But, you can also change the
         		  distribution of the panes within Pliny's window as well by dragging the
         		  boundaries right or left between the Resource Explorer, web page view, and the
         		  reference area if you wish. Indeed, you may want to increase the width of the
         		  web page display. You could close the Resource Explorer pane by clicking on the
         		  X in its tab, although we don't do this in this tutorial. If you do close it,
         		  you can bring it back at any time by pushing its button in the tool bar
         		  (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/resourceExplorer.gif">) which you can find in
         		  the toolbar near the top of Pliny's window. At the moment the reference area
         		  within the browser area (to its right) is not doing anything for you and you
         		  may be tempted to make it as small as possible. We'll soon see how it is used,
         		  however. There is more discussion on pane management in the section
         		  <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes</a> elsewhere in the help that you
         		  might want to consult after you have finished this tutorial. For now, you might
         		  try moving the boundaries a little just to see how that is done.
      </p>
      <h2>Using the Browser</h2>
      <p>Let us now shift our focus for a while to the editor pane itself. In
         		  the next set of figures we have stopped showing the Resource Explorer, although
         		  in fact it will still be showing on your screen.
      </p>
      <p>Here, then, is the web browser as it appears in Pliny's Editor Pane,
         		  with the main parts labelled in orange:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-screen.gif"></p>
      <p>For more details about Pliny's web browser consult its
         		  <a href="ref.webBrowser.html">reference section</a>. For now, however, all you
         		  need to know is that the web page you are seeing here is generated by one of
         		  your usual machine's web browser (perhaps Internet Explorer, Safari, or
         		  FireFox), and that the smaller right area of the editor pane (currently empty)
         		  -- the <i>reference area</i> -- is added by Pliny as a space for recording
         		  notes you might want to make as you read the web page -- more about this
         		  shortly.
      </p>
      <p>It is important to understand that are <i>two</i> toolbars appearing
         		  on <i>different</i> parts of the embedded web browser: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li> 
               			 
               <p>First, we look at the toolbar area directly under the tab. This is
                  				called the "Pliny toolbar" and we'll see later that it appears at or near the
                  				top of the editor pane in more than one place in Pliny. It contains three
                  				parts, labelled here:
               </p> 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-pliny-toolbar.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>For the moment we'll focus on the right end -- labelled here as
                  				the "Annotator Toolbar".It contains icons for tools you will use to work with
                  				materials in the associated reference area (the area to the right in the figure
                  				above). The tool buttons it contains will change somewhat depending upon the
                  				kind of thing you are working with in the editor pane area. In the general
                  				introduction to toolbars (described in more detail <a href="intro.toolbars.html">elsewhere</a> among these help pages) it is called the
                  				<i>Editor Toolbar</i>. It is labelled the <i>Annotator Toolbar</i> above.
               </p> 
               			 
               <p>Also in the Pliny Toolbar, and to the left of its Annotator
                  				Toolbar section you will probably have noticed a field labelled above as
                  				"Resource Name". In Pliny a web page can be one kind of item called a
                  				"resource", and all Pliny resources, including web pages, can have a name. For
                  				a web page the name starts out being the title taken from the web page iteself,
                  				but you can change the name of the Pliny resource for this webpage by typing a
                  				new one in this field. More about this later.
               </p> 
               			 
               <p>At the left end of the Pliny toolbar is the icon labelled "Drag
                  				and Drop" object. We will explain its use elsewhere in these tutorials, but we
                  				can briefly say here that this icon can be used to drag and drop a reference to
                  				the current resource (here a web page) to other places in Pliny. We'll see
                  				later how this is useful.
               </p> 
            </li>
            <li> 
               			 
               <p>Below the Pliny toolbar is a toolbar that is specific to web
                  				browsing and provides conventional Web navigation services. It is labelled
                  				<i>Navigation Toolbar</i> in the figure above and is displayed directly above
                  				the area of the screen showing a web page. It looks like this:
               </p>
               			 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-nav-toolbar.gif"></p>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The <i>Navigation Toolbar</i> is used to manage web browsing. For
         		  example, in it is a box (the browser's location field) into which you can put
         a
         		  URL (showing here <tt>http://pliny.cch.kcl.ac.uk/</tt>). You can use it in the
         		  same way that you use the URL area in your browser when it is operating outside
         		  of Pliny. The URL can be either typed in there (in which case you push the
         		  green arrow-head "go button" after it to go to the URL you provided), or you
         		  can copy a URL from, say, your regular browser and place it on the location
         		  field.
      </p>
      <p>Once you are viewing a web page of interest it will display and
         		  operate exactly as it does outside of Pliny. You can, for instance, click on
         		  any links you find in the page itself to navigate to other pages -- exactly as
         		  you would with a conventional web browser. After you have navigated from one
         		  webpage to another the other buttons in the Navigation Toolbar will become more
         		  useful. For example, you will find there a back button (the arrow pointing to
         		  the left at the left end of the Browser control area) which acts exactly like
         		  the normal browser back button. There are other buttons that you can click on
         		  to perform the normal range of browser operations. These are described in
         		  detail in the Pliny help reference section for Pliny's
         		  <a href="ref.webBrowser.html">Embedded browser</a> in the section called
         		  <i>Browser Controls</i>. You might want to consult it after you have finished
         		  this tutorial.
      </p>
      <h2>Recording Notes</h2>
      <p>One uses Pliny is to record notes about things you find interesting in
         		  materials that you are reading. Suppose, for example, that you have turned on
         		  Pliny's web browser and are working with material on the WebSite "Proceedings
         		  of Old Bailey" (<tt>http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/</tt>, project directors:
         		  Tim Hitchcock and Robert Shoemaker), and come across the reports of the trial
         		  of a person named Mary Allen for theft. As you read the note you are struck by
         		  the prominent role of London's Night Watch in the trial's proceedings, and you
         		  decide to record this observation in a note.
      </p>
      <p>This is where the area that is currently empty to the right of the web
         		  browser area -- the <i>reference area</i> -- comes in. The reference area is
         		  linked to the current web page that the browser is displaying, and will change
         		  each time you navigate to a new web page. Since it is attached to the current
         		  web page you can create notes that you wish to associate with a web page by
         		  putting them in this area. Any time you return to this page in the future the
         		  notes you have placed there will re-appear -- rather as if you had written them
         		  in the margins of the pages of a book.
      </p>
      <p>The reference area Pliny provides for you is a 2-dimensional space --
         		  you can (and must!) lay out notes that you wish to record for this web page
         		  here. Think of it as similar to the margin of a book, with the key useful
         		  difference that you can make it much wider than the normal width of a book
         		  margin if you have a lot of notes to associate with this page. How do you
         		  create a note? 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>First, you must tell Pliny that you wish to create a note to
               			 associate with this web page. Do this by first clicking on the <i>New Note</i>
               			 icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">) you will find above the
               			 Annotation Toolbar we identified a short time ago (be sure you click on the
               			 correct <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> icon -- there will be two
               			 of them on the screen. The <i>wrong</i> one is the icon that appears in the top
               			 right corner of Pliny's Resource Explorer pane -- don't click on this one,
               			 since it does something a little different from what we want right now -- we'll
               			 see a use for it later in this tutorial). Alternatively, there is also a
               			 keyboard shortcut available to put Pliny in its "new note" mode: the F5
               			 key.
            </li>
            <li>Now, move the mouse pointer back over the reference area to the
               			 right of the web page display. You will find that the pointer has changed its
               			 shape to look like this: 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/create-request-pointer.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>This is telling you that Pliny is waiting for you to specify where
                  				in the reference area you want the note (actually <i>references</i> to notes
                  				and Pliny objects -- we'll describe what this means in more detail elsewhere)
                  				to appear.
               </p> 
               			 
               <p>Thus, we must first specify a space in the reference area where we
                  				want the new note to appear. Since this is the first note we have created for
                  				this page the reference area that will contain it is currently empty. Hence it
                  				probably doesn't particularly matter where it goes -- just define an area that
                  				is relatively small in the space by holding down the mouse button and dragging
                  				out a small space from top left to bottom right. As you drag Pliny will show
                  				you a grey area representing the area you have specified:
               </p>
               			 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/gef-area-drag.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>When the area is about this size release the mouse button. Pliny
                  				will transform the area you have defined into what is called in Pliny a
                  				<i>reference object</i> for a new note. It will look like this:
               </p>
               			 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-newnote.gif"></p>
            </li>
            <li>We have defined a place into which a note can be put, but we
               			 haven't actually recorded one there yet. In Pliny notes have two pieces of text
               			 associated with them -- a note <i>title</i>, and note <i>textual content</i>.
               			 When Pliny defines a note reference object in this way for us it creates a
               			 working title for the note based on the title associated with the current
               			 webpage, and you can see the title showing in the top area of the reference
               			 object (well, at least part of it is showing -- the title is currently too long
               			 to fit here, so all we see is its beginning: "Browse - Central Cr..."). Let us
               			 change this note title to something more meaningful. Double click over the
               			 title area in the top of the reference object (over the words "Browse - Central
               			 Cr...", and Pliny will allow you to replace this text with something new --
               			 change it to "Night Watch". 
               			 
               <p>Now, we are also ready to put in some body text for this note. The
                  				light green area which takes up most of the reference object's area is used to
                  				store the notes textual content. Double click on it, and type in some text that
                  				you want to store as the body of the note, something like "<tt>The night watch
                     				is prominent in the trial of Mary Allen</tt>". When this is done the screen
                  				area will look like this:
               </p>
            </li>
         </ul> 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-2.gif"></p>
      <p>The note you have created has been associated with this web page by
         		  Pliny. As long as you keep this note around Pliny will show it to you whenever
         		  you return to the same web page (by "same" here, we mean the web page with the
         		  same URL).
      </p>
      <p>You can see that this is a kind of annotation action, similar to what
         		  you might in a book. However, when we write in the margin of a book we don't
         		  feel the need to provide a title for our writing! Why does a Pliny note have a
         		  title? Well, although this new note appears here beside the web page it belongs
         		  to, and we may not really need a title here for it to be understood, you will
         		  soon see that a Pliny note can appear in other contexts within Pliny where
         		  there is too little space to show the entire note. In this situation a title
         		  for the note is useful -- the text it contains is relatively short and if the
         		  title is carefully chosen you will be able to identify which note it is you are
         		  seeing even if only the title is visible at the time.
      </p>
      <p>Enough now about the first note. Suppose now that you wish to add
         		  another note to the same page -- further down in the page you have found a bit
         		  of the testimony of the watchman that is interesting to you. It would be nice
         		  if one could highlight a spot in the webpage text such as this which would
         		  simply say "something interesting is <i>here</i> on this page". Unfortunately,
         		  the browser software (Internet Explorer, FireFox, Safari, etc.) which is
         		  displaying the web page to us within Pliny is not developed as a part of
         		  Pliny's software development, and it does not tell Pliny where items that it is
         		  displaying (including text) are located on the screen. Since Pliny cannot find
         		  out where the text is on the page it is not possible for Pliny to attach
         		  objects to it.
      </p>
      <p>Since we cannot attach an object to the text of interest we have to
         		  draw attention to it in some other way. One way is to create a note in the
         		  reference area for this page that contains a <i>quotation</i> of the text we
         		  want to remember on the page. We could create this note containing the
         		  interesting quotation in the same way we described above -- clicking on the New
         		  Note button, defining an area on the screen for our new note, and then typing
         		  in the text from the web page. Pliny, however, provides a short cut that uses
         a
         		  drag-and-drop gesture. 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>Select the text you want to copy as a note into Pliny. Then,
               			 holding the mouse button down, drag the pointer into the reference area. Pliny
               			 will show you the outline of a reference object box that it is ready to create
               			 for you when you release the button:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-dnd.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>(The orange line shown in the figure does not in fact appear on
                  				the screen while you are doing the drag and drop. We show it here to show you
                  				the path of the mouse as you drag the selected text from the browser window
                  				into the reference area.) 
               </p>
            </li>
            <li> 
               			 
               <p>When you release the mouse button, a reference object will appear,
                  				with the text you have dragged from the webpage as its content:
               </p>
               			 
               <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-dnd2.gif"></p> 
               			 
               <p>We just used drag and drop to take some text from a current web
                  				page and turn it into a note inside Pliny. Drag and dropping of text from any
                  				source -- even one outside of Pliny -- that supports drag and drop (some text,
                  				say, from Microsoft Word, for example), will work the same way -- select the
                  				text in a Word document outside of Pliny and drag into a Pliny reference area
                  				to make Pliny turn the dragged text into a note. We have tried to develop Pliny
                  				to make use of drag and drop in various situations because it is a kind of
                  				interaction with the computer -- a gesture -- which often seems the most
                  				natural way to indicate what you want done.
               </p> 
               			 
               <p>Let us now return to the note Pliny has just created from the text
                  				on the web page. First, we can see that the text takes up more space in the new
                  				note's reference object than the space currently provided by it. Notice, then,
                  				the scroll bar to the right which allows us in this situation to scroll through
                  				all the text. We will see in a moment how to change the size and position of
                  				the notes we have now created. However, sometimes it is useful to keep the
                  				reference object smaller than the size of the text it contains.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>The created note has not been given a very good title ("New Note")
               			 by Pliny (although, if Pliny sees what looks like title text beginning in the
               			 text selection it has been given, it will take this text and put it in the
               			 note's title). We can change the title of this note by double-clicking in the
               			 title area and typing in a new title (say, "Watchman's Testimony").
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>We used drag and drop as a quick way to create a new note from some
         		  selected text. We have made Pliny support dragging and dropping of materials in
         		  any many ways as we could, so that the creation and management of materials
         		  involves as little effort on your part as we could manage. Studies have shown
         		  that note-taking works best when the system burdens the note taker with as
         		  little additional mental effort as possible, and often we found that drag and
         		  drop seems to be a most natural gesture.
      </p>
      <h2>Managing Notes in the Reference Area</h2>
      <p>We now have two notes that we have created (albeit by two different
         		  means) in the reference area associated with this webpage. Any time in the
         		  future that we return to view this webpage from within Pliny these notes will
         		  be displayed -- in the same way that once you write in the margins of a book
         		  each time to return to that page in the book your notes are still there.
      </p>
      <p>Unlike in a book, however, what appears in the reference area is
         		  changeable at any time, and it is now time to examine how one manages materials
         		  that are displayed there. We will not mention all the possibilities here in
         		  this introductory tutorial, but all the details are described in the help
         		  document <a href="ref.annotationArea.html">Annotation/Reference Area</a>, which
         		  you might want to review after finishing this tutorial.
      </p>
      <h3>Changing the contents of notes</h3>
      <p>First, The contents and title of notes can be changed at any time.
         			 Simply double click on either the title or the note body area and edit the text
         			 as you wish.
      </p>
      <h3>Resizing reference objects</h3>
      <p>A note is displayed inside something called a "reference object". We
         			 will describe more about the parts of the reference object shortly. However,
         			 you can see that of the two notes we have made the area for the note contents
         			 for the first note is too large for the amount of text it contains, and the
         			 area provided for the contents of the second note is too small (although Pliny,
         			 recognising that there is more text to display than room to show it provides a
         			 scroll bar to allow you see all the text it contains. One can change the size
         			 of a reference object any time you wish. To do so, first select the reference
         			 object by clicking (single-click) in its title area (showing green here --
         			 careful to avoid clicking on any of the icons displayed there in the top left
         			 and right corners, since they act as buttons that will cause other changes to
         			 happen that we will describe later). Pliny will show that it is selected by
         			 displaying a darker black border with selection handles around it:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-select.gif"></p>
      <p>You can then adjust the size by pointing and dragging (by holding
         			 down the mouse button) on any of the 8 "handles" (the little boxes) that are
         			 displayed.
      </p>
      <h3>Moving reference objects</h3>
      <p>Since reference objects sit on a 2D reference area, one can arrange
         			 them by positioning them in this area. You can, if it seems useful, use a
         			 spatial arrangements of the objects to mean anything that you wish. For now,
         			 you can try dragging a selected object by simply pointing at its header (to
         			 first select it) and dragging the object around by moving the mouse while
         			 holding down the mouse button. You can select several objects in a reference
         			 area (material in the section <a href="ref.annotationArea.html">Annotation/Reference Area</a> tells you how), and
         			 if you do so, and drag any of them around, all the items then selected will
         			 move as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Deleting a reference object</h3>
      <p>If you wish to delete a reference object you first select it, and
         			 then choose "Delete" from the edit menu (or push the delete key). You can
         			 select a block of objects. All selected objects will be deleted.
      </p>
      <p>If you delete something by mistake and wish to bring it back you can
         			 use the Edit/Undo menu command to do so. Indeed, other actions (such as moving
         			 or resizing) can be undone in this way if you wish.
      </p>
      <h3>Connecting reference objects</h3>
      <p>Pliny allows you to draw a line between any two reference objects in
         			 a reference area. Drawing such a line will imply that the two objects are
         			 connected, although the exact meaning of the connection need not be specified
         			 (however it can be made clearer by associating a "type" with the connection
         			 line -- see the discussion about types in the section on the
         			 <a href="ref.typeManagerView.html">Type Manager,</a> elsewhere in these help
         			 documents if you want to know more about this).
      </p>
      <p>Suppose we want to make evident the connection between the two notes
         			 we have created by drawing a line between them. Do the following: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>First tell Pliny you want to define a connecting line between the
               				notes.You indicate this to Pliny by clicking on the "connection" icon
               				(<img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">) which you can find beside
               				the "create note" button we clicked on earlier in the Annotation Area toolbar.
               				Alternatively, there is a keyboard shortcut available: F6.
            </li>
            <li>Now, place the pointer inside the first of the two notes and,
               				holding the mouse button down, drag to the second note, and then release. Pliny
               				will draw an arrow between the two objects:
               				
               <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-connector.gif"></p>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The line is connected to the objects at each end -- if you move
         			 either object you will find that the line follows it. You can delete a line by
         			 clicking on it to select it and by pushing the delete key or choosing menu
         			 "edit/delete".
      </p>
      <h3>Changing the colour of objects</h3>
      <p>The colour of objects (both reference objects and connectors) is
         			 controlled by the "type" associated with them and you can change the colour of
         			 any object in the reference area by either changing the colours associated with
         			 the type associated with that object (in which all objects or connectors of
         			 that type will have their colour changed as well), or by changing the type
         			 associated with the object. There is more discussion about "types" in Pliny in
         			 the help section about the <a href="ref.typeManagerView.html">Type
            			 Manager</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Minimizing</h3>
      <p>Any Reference object, such as those holding the notes we have
         			 associated with this webpage, can be minimized so that it takes up less space
         			 in the reference area. When a reference object is minimized only its title (and
         			 the icons in the title area) show. As we shall see later, reference objects to
         			 notes can always be minimized and revealed fully, although some other things
         			 that reference objects can display can show <i>only</i> their title area -- can
         			 only show minimized, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>Let us minimize the Watchman's Testimony note. Locate the minimize
         			 icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/closeNote.gif">) at the right end of its
         			 title area, and click on it. The object will switch to its minimized
         			 display:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-min2.gif"></p>
      <p>To put it back to its original size click on the right-end icon (now
         			 showing "un-minimize" icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/openNote.gif">).
         			 Pliny will remember the last un-minimized depth of the object and will use that
         			 to restore the item to an un-minimized size.
      </p>
      <p>While an item is minimized you will find that you can change its
         			 length, but not its height by dragging on the objects handles.
      </p>
      <p>As you can see, there are other icons in the title area of our
         			 note's reference object. We will introduce them elsewhere in these tutorials.
         			 If you want more detail now, you can consult the reference section of these
         			 help documents, in document <a href="ref.referenceObject.html">Reference
            			 Object</a> for more detailed information.
      </p>
      <h2>Managing materials in Pliny: The Resource Explorer</h2>
      <p>Pliny stores materials that it can display to you in objects called
         		  Resources, and keeps track of those resources in a view object called the
         		  "Resource Explorer". You might recall that Pliny started with this Resource
         		  Explorer showing in the narrow left-hand pane. We now turn our focus from the
         		  web browser in the editor pane to this Resource Explorer pane. We will
         		  introduce you here to the basic ways that it operates, but a section in the
         		  help's reference section descibes it in more detail. After reading this section
         		  of the tutorial you might wish to review what it says there about it. The
         		  section is called (not surprisingly) the <a href="ref.resourceExplorer.html">Resource Explorer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>If, after we carry out the steps in this tutorial above (creating two
         		  notes attached to a webpage), we turn our attention back to the Resource
         		  Explorer pane we can see that something has changed:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-3.gif"></p>
      <p>Two xmall "&gt;"-shaped icons have been positioned beside two of the
         		  folder categories: the one called "Note" and the one called "Web Browser" (the
         		  "&gt;" icon symbol will be displayed on Windows machines, on the Macintosh or a
         		  Linux machine a different symbol appropriate to their GUI might be used). The
         		  Resource Explorer provides you with a hierarchical display that gives you
         		  access to all the resources that Pliny knows about, and since we have created
         		  two notes attached to one webpage -- three resources in all -- there are now
         		  things to show you in the Resource Explorer's hierarchical display. If we click
         		  on the "&gt;" symbol to open them to the next level, and then open the next
         		  level also we will see the Resource Explorer looking like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-3a.gif"></p>
      <p>The Resource Explorer always gives you access to <i>all</i> Pliny
         		  resources you currently have in your version of Pliny. It organises its top
         		  level by listing of the <i>kinds</i> of Resources it knows about. Inside the
         		  resource type folder level ("Note" and "Web Browser") you will find a folder
         		  named by a single letter (or number). Resources of each type are filed by the
         		  initial letter or number of their name. As you might recall, we created two
         		  notes: one called "Night Watch", and the other "Watchman's Testimony", and
         		  hence the 2nd level folders under "Note" are "N" and "W". If we open these in
         		  turn we will see items that reference the resources themselves. The &gt;-icon
         		  in front of each resource reference shows that there are other levels below
         		  this one in the Resource Explorer display. The help reference material about
         		  the <a href="ref.resourceExplorer.html">Resource Explorer</a> explains what
         		  these further levels are for, and you might wish to take a look at this when
         		  you finish this tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>We cam see that the act of creating the <i>two</i> notes attached to
         		  this <i>Old Bailey</i> page has created <i>three</i> new resources: the two
         		  note resources, and a resource for the webpage that contains them: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>First, the new notes, called "Note Watch" and "Watchman's
               			 Testimony" are displayed here in the <i>Note</i> folder of the Resource
               			 Explorer. Observe that although references are provided here to notes Pliny
               			 knows about only the note's <i>names</i> are displayed by the Explorer. It is
               			 unable to show you the textual content of any note. Here is one very good
               			 reason to be sure that notes always have meaningful names. 
            </li>
            <li>Furthermore, a reference to the web page to which the note is
               			 attached appears under the <i>Web Browser</i> folder. This webpage resource was
               			 created at the moment that the first note was associated with the page. Note
               			 that Pliny automatically creates a Web Browser resource for pages with which
               			 other Pliny resources (such as the two notes we attached to this page) have
               			 been attached. If you navigate through various web pages with the Pliny web
               			 browser without creating notes for them, they will not be recorded as Pliny
               			 resources, and will not turn up here. 
               			 
               <p>All resources in Pliny have names attached to them, and we can see
                  				the name showing here: "Browse - Central Criminal Court". Where did this name
                  				come from? When Pliny created the resource for this page, it took the name that
                  				the <i>Old Bailey</i> site had provided as the title for the webpage. You can
                  				change this default name for this resource either by editing it here in the
                  				Resource Explorer, or in the field in which it appears in the Pliny toolbar
                  				when the browser is displaying it. We will talk more about this very soon
                  				now.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Two further observations about the Resource Explorer: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>First, the Explorer is "live" and will track your work. If you add
               			 a new note to our web page, for example, the new note will appear in the
               			 explorer list the moment it is created. If you delete a note, it disappears
               			 from the Explorer View as well.
            </li>
            <li>Second, in the figures above we cannot see all the text of some of
               			 the resource names because the space we have currently set aside for the
               			 Explorer with the Plinys screen is too narrow. You can easily change the amount
               			 of window space allocated to the explorer by dragging the boundary on the right
               			 side of the explorer to the right. Alternatively, if you still want to see the
               			 full name of a resource even if it is off the edge of the pane, you can place
               			 the mouse pointer at the pane and wait a moment. A tooltip will appear showing
               			 you the full resource name.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>As we mentioned earlier, when a new resource for a web page is set up
         		  by Pliny it takes the title of the web page as the initial name of the web-page
         		  resource, but you can change this name in the Resource Explorer if you wish
         		  without affecting what it points to. Here, for example, the Old Bailey website
         		  is set up so that the HTML title for many of its web pages is the same. This is
         		  not very useful to us, because the corresponding resource name is what we use
         		  to identify a particular resource. Since Old Bailey uses the same name all the
         		  time, if we recorded notes to a number of different Old Bailey trials then we
         		  would not be able to distinguish the web page referenes by this name alone. It
         		  might be better, then, to change the name of the resource that links to Mary
         		  Allen's trial so that it is more helpful. To change the name to, say, "Old
         		  Bailey: Mary Allen Trial" here in the Resource Explorer click on the resource
         		  name you want to change and type in a new one. After you have entered the new
         		  name for the resource it will always appear with the name you have given
         		  it:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-4.gif"></p>
      <p>Even though you have changed the name so that it no longer matches any
         		  of the material on the web page itself Pliny will always remember the actual
         		  URL the resource refers to for you.
      </p>
      <p>That's enough about the Resource Explorer for now, but we will return
         		  to it later.
      </p>
      <h2>Using a note to keep track of things</h2>
      <p>Now, let us suppose that you decide you are interested in the role of
         		  the Night Watch in London and in Old Bailey trials, and want to look for other
         		  web pages that talk about this. After a little bit of a search through a few
         		  pages on the <i>Old Bailey</i> site, and then at other pages found via a search
         		  by Google you have found a few relevant pages, and you've made a few notes on
         		  each of the relevant pages. Because of this Pliny has not only created Note
         		  Resources, but tracked and recorded as Web Browser Resources the pages that you
         		  have annotated (it does not automatically create web browser resources for
         		  pages you merely pass through without annotating). Because The Explorer tracks
         		  what we do, you can see that all the web page resources will be located in its
         		  Web Browser folder:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-4a.gif"></p>
      <p>We have only 4 web pages on the subject of the night watch in London
         		  so far, but its a start! Suppose that you expect to find much more in the WWW
         		  about this subject, and want to begin to keep track and to organise these pages
         		  as a little research topic. That is the next subject in this tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>So far we have only seen Pliny notes placed on web pages, and used as
         		  a place in which a commentary on the page you are currently looking at can be
         		  put. However, they can be used in other ways as well. Let us now show you how
         		  you could use a Pliny Note to keep track of and organise other Pliny
         		  resources.
      </p>
      <p>The first step is to create a Pliny Note for this purpose called, let
         		  us say, "Night Watch Web References" which we will use to do this job. Up until
         		  now we have created notes that were attached to a web page -- this time we want
         		  to create a note which does not in fact appear on a web page -- that will at
         		  least start out on its own, and will function, instead, as a kind of <i>entry
            		  point</i> into our resource collection about this topic.
      </p>
      <p>Note the New Note Icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">)
         		  which appears in the top of the Resource Explorer's tab:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-4b.gif"></p>
      <p>This button can be used to create a new note which is not attached to
         		  any other Pliny resource such as a a web page. There is also a menu option
         		  "File/New Pliny Note" which serves the same purpose and which you could use
         		  instead if you prefer. Click on the button now. In response Pliny's "New Note"
         		  wizard will appear:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-4c.gif"></p>
      <p>In this box you would type in the name of the note you are asking
         		  Pliny to create (the figure shows the wizard screen as it would appear after we
         		  have already typed the name in. There are other options here to in the form of
         		  two checkboxes. We will describe the use of the two checkbox fields that appear
         		  in the wizard later in this tutorial, so don't worry about them now. There is
         		  nothing else to add to this Wizard, so click on the Finish button .
      </p>
      <p>In response, Pliny will create a new note for you with the given name
         		  and will display it for you in the editor pane using a component of Pliny
         		  called the <i>Note Editor</i>.
      </p>
      <h3>The Note Editor</h3>
      <p>The <i>Note Editor</i> is a tool that can be used to manage the
         			 content of Pliny notes. When we first see it open for our new note it looks
         			 like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor1.gif"></p>
      <p>You can see that the note editor has appeared in the editor pane. A
         			 tab for this new item appears at the top of the pane and the tab shows the name
         			 of the note Pliny has just created and now opened for us. Directly below the
         			 tab we can see the Pliny Toolbar, which looks almost exactly the same as it did
         			 in Pliny's web browser. The components are very similar: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>To the left end we see the "Drag and Drop Icon". Here it is
               				showing the Icon Pliny uses for notes: The letter N inside the small yellow
               				circle.
            </li>
            <li>Next to the right we see the Note's name field. We can use this
               				field to change the name if we wish.
            </li>
            <li>To the right end we see a set of icons representing various kinds
               				of actions we might want to take with the note. Note that most of these actions
               				are the same as those we saw in the Web Browser's version of the Pliny
               				Toolbar.
            </li>
         </ul>Below the Pliny toolbar we se, as we saw in the web browser, that
         		  the editor pane is divided horizontally into two parts. Why are there two
         		  parts? You recall why there were two parts for the web browser. There, the left
         		  part displayed the resource's <i>content</i> (for a web page resource, the web
         		  page itself), and the right part displayed a <i>reference area</i> for that
         		  page. It is the same with the Note Editor.In the Note Editor, the left part of
         		  the editor pane (middle division in the figure above) is where the <i>textual
            		  content</i> of a note is displayed and can be edited. The right part displays a
         		  <i>reference area</i> for that note. As in the Web Browser, the boundary
         		  between the two areas can be moved, and as we shall see sometimes a note will
         		  be created with little or no textual content, but a lot of references. Under
         		  these conditions we might well wish to move the boundary to the left to give
         		  more room on the screen to the reference area.
      </p>
      <p>The content area to the left is, in fact, further subdivided into
         			 two areas. At the top in the small grey band we can see our new note's name.
         			 The note's name as it is displayed in this grey area can be edited simply by
         			 clicking over it there and typing. We specified a suitable name when we used
         			 the New Note wizard to create the note for us, so we don't need to change that.
         			 For now, let us put some textual content in our note which will explain what it
         			 is for. We click in the main white area below the little grey area containing
         			 our title and type in some text to describe what this note is for:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor2.gif"></p>
      <p>OK, so we have the note created, Pliny has opened it in the Note
         			 Editor, and we have put a short bit of text describing the note in the note's
         			 content area. How will we use this to keep track of materials about the Night
         			 Watch? We use right side of the Note Editor for that -- the note's reference
         			 area. This reference area is associated with this particular note and it works
         			 in the same way as the reference areas attached to web pages we saw before --
         			 it can be used to hold references to other Pliny resources that we want to
         			 associated with this note.
      </p>
      <p>So, here we want to put references to the web pages that we have
         			 already recorded in Pliny that speak about the London night watch. How do we
         			 create them? There are several ways but, given that we already have the
         			 Resource Explorer open on the items that we want to refer to in our note, we
         			 can use it as the source for the references. To create new references to the
         			 web pages point at the various icons of items you wish to reference (here,
         			 since they are web pages it is the WWW icon:
         			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/browserIcon.gif">), and drag them to our note's
         			 reference area. This is what happens when we drag the first reference (to
         			 "Before the Bobbkes") to the "Night Watch" note's reference area:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor3.gif"></p>
      <p>(the orange lines and boxes in the above figure show what has been
         			 dragged and where it was dropped, and do not appear on the screen as you do
         			 this operation)
      </p>
      <p>We have now created a reference to the "Before the Bobbies" webpage.
         			 You can see a small version of the web screen in the reference object that has
         			 been created. We don't need to see that, so we shall minimize the size of the
         			 reference object by clicking on the "Minimization button" that is identfied in
         			 the figure.. Now let us repeat the operations (dragging and minimizing) for the
         			 other three references in the Resource Explorer to web pages in the Old Bailey
         			 website that speak about the Night Watch: references to web pages that talk
         			 about the Night Watch in the reference area of this note.
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor3a.gif"></p>
      <p>Let us pause for a moment to observe that three things have happened
         			 here that we haven't seen before: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>First, we see how you can use drag and drop from the Resource
               				Explorer to create a reference to one Pliny resource in the reference area of
               				another. Although we have dragged web page resource items to create references
               				to them here, we could just as easily used the Resource Explorer to locate a
               				useful Note, and dragged that to a reference area to create a reference to a
               				note instead. See the section on drag and drop in the
               				<a href="ref.annotationArea.html">Annotation Area</a> reference section of these
               				help documents for more details about this.
            </li>
            <li>Second, we have seen, for the first time, that Pliny can display
               				not only references to Pliny notes in a reference area, but also references to
               				other Pliny resources -- here references to web page resources. We'll see
               				shortly how these can be used. These references, although to web pages rather
               				than notes, share many characteristics with Notes references -- they can be
               				minimised, moved, changed in size, deleted, etc. Also, the name of the resource
               				can be edited by double clicking on it (although, remember that you are editing
               				the name of the resource through a reference -- if you change the name here it
               				will immediately change in all places that this resource is referenced.
            </li>
            <li>Thirdly, we have left the note editor area divided more or less
               				half and half between the content area and the reference area. However, we can
               				drag the boundary between them to make one larger than the other if that is
               				useful -- if there were many references and we needed a larger reference area
               				to contain them all, for example, we could drag the boundary to the left. Pliny
               				will remember the place where the dividing line is left by you and will place
               				it in the same place the next time you open this note.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>In summary, 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>Pliny supports the annotation of resources -- resources being
               				digital objects such as web pages, PDF files or image, but also notes.
            </li>
            <li>A resource has three parts: (i) a name, (ii) some content; the
               				form of which varies depending upon the kind of resource; and (iii) an
               				associated space to which some sort of commentary materials can be attached --
               				notes or references to other Pliny resources. For Web pages and notes the
               				associated space is displayed beside the resource to which it applies. As you
               				will see later in this tutorial, for other kinds of resources (images or PDF
               				files), it sits over top of them and can be used for annotation.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Reopening web pages</h3>
      <p>We have now seen that both web pages and notes can be displayed in
         			 Pliny's editor area. You can reopen any note or web page in this way by double
         			 clicking on its icon either in the Resource Explorer or in an associated
         			 Reference Object. We have now created our <i>Night Watch Web References</i>
         			 object and put references to objects of interest on its reference area. If in
         a
         			 couple of months we are looking at the <i>Night Watch Web References</i> object
         			 in its Note Editor, and, after noticing the reference to the Mary Allen trial
         			 we find want to visit that page again, we can ask Pliny to open it for us by
         			 simply double clicking on the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/browserIcon.gif">
         			 icon that appears at the left end of its reference (or, we can select the
         			 relevant reference object, and choose "Open selected" from the contextual
         			 menu). Pliny will respond to the double-click on the icon by starting up its
         			 web browser, pointing it to the URL associated with this resource, and loading
         			 any associated resource references (notes, say) that have been associated with
         			 this web page. We will have both the web page, and the notes we previously
         			 attached to it back on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>This also works within the Resource Explorer: if we find an object
         			 we'd like to view (Note, Web page, etc) listed in the Resource Explorer we can
         			 ask Pliny to open it for us by double clicking on its icon there. This will
         			 open the object for you: bringing back on screen both the content and the
         			 associated references.
      </p>
      <h3>Organising references</h3>
      <p>Now that we have the four references to pages we have found that
         			 related to the Night Watch in London we observe that two of them refer to
         			 trials where a Night Watch member was involved in the proceedings, and two were
         			 references to material that talks about the Night Watch. We would like to
         			 organise the references so that this is more evident.
      </p>
      <p>First, we can simply drag the items to different parts of the area
         			 so that the references to trials are in one area, and the references to
         			 information about the night watch are somewhere else.:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor4.gif"></p>
      <p>We have put the references to materials about the night watch
         			 together in the top group, and references to trials in the bottom. Sometimes
         			 simply grouping objects by placing them close together is enough to remind that
         			 they seem to be connected in some way. However, we might wish to make the
         			 distinction more obvious by labelling it. The most straightforward way to do
         			 this is to take advantage of the fact that (although we haven't seen this
         			 explicitly used up to now), a reference to a Pliny note can be used as a
         			 <i>containment item</i>. We'll use the shortcut mechanism provided within Pliny
         			 to set this up. Select the items you want to group together (the top two), then
         			 choose "Group Objects" from the contextual menu (highlighted with a red box in
         			 the following figure). You can see the contextual menu by either clicking with
         			 the other mouse button (if you have a two button mouse) or by holding down the
         			 Control key while clicking (if you have a one-button mouse):
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor5.gif"></p>
      <p>In response, Pliny will take the selected objects; put them into the
         			 reference area associated with a new Pliny note it creates, and show you the
         			 reference to the note in its containment format:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor6.gif"></p>
      <p>As usual, Pliny has invented a name for this new containment note.
         			 Double click on the name to change it to something better -- perhaps "About the
         			 Night Watch":
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor7.gif"></p>
      <p>We have not seen the containment display in a note reference before.
         			 If you recall, I mentioned that, like other Pliny resources, a note has some
         			 content (for a note it is text) and a reference area associated with it. Pliny
         			 notes are unique as Pliny resources in that they allow you to display either
         			 the note's <i>content</i>, <i>or</i> the note's <i>reference area</i> in a
         			 reference object, and switch between these two kinds of display at any time.
         			 Like other reference objects, you an change the size of it to show more or less
         			 of the reference area. You can drag the objects around in the containment area,
         			 drag it out of the containing area altogether, or drag a new object in.
      </p>
      <p>Now that we have seen a note reference as a containment area it is
         			 useful to see how one would switch the containment area view back to the usual
         			 note view. You can switch between the two views of a Pliny note by clicking on
         			 the button in the title bar that we haven't yet mentioned. The button toggles
         			 you between the two modes. At present the relevant button is displaying as
         			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/showContents.gif"> and you can see it as the
         			 third in from the right on the "About the Night Watch title area. Clicking on
         			 it switches the reference object to display the note's textual content
         			 instead:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor8.gif"></p>
      <p>Note that the button's icon has changed to the one it uses to show
         			 that it now can be clicked to switch back to displaying the note's reference
         			 area: <img align="middle" src="images/icons/showMap.gif">. Now that we are seeing the
         			 associated note's textual content rather than its reference area the space
         			 below the title has gone blank (although it has gained a bit of colour). Of
         			 course this is because this note has no textual content at present -- it has,
         			 so far, just been created by the contextual menu's "Group Objects" command and
         			 as a result currently uses only its reference area to hold references to other
         			 resources it now apparently "contains". Perhaps we should double click on the
         			 textual content area to type in some text that describes what this note is
         			 about:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor9.gif"></p>
      <p>Now we have something in both this note's content element and its
         			 reference element it is perhaps clearer what is going on when we switch between
         			 viewing them by clicking on the toggle button. We can make this distinction
         			 clearer still by double clicking on the
         			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> icon in the upper left corner of
         			 the reference object to open this particular item in its own Note Editor. If we
         			 do this we will see the note editor showing both aspects of this note shown at
         			 one time:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor10.gif"></p>
      <p>As you will recall, the note editor shows the textual content of the
         			 note in the left area of the editor pane, and its reference area in the right.
         			 As we might expect, the textual content is as we have just typed it in a moment
         			 ago, and the reference area contains the references to the two web pages that
         			 were put there when we created the note for this containment purpose in the
         			 first place. The connections between the contents of the textual content or the
         			 reference area are "live". If we change either here in the note editor the
         			 effect is seen immediately in all references to this note. Furthermore, if we
         			 change either the textual content or the contents of the reference through an
         			 associated reference object for this note the change will be seen here as
         			 well.
      </p>
      <p>Now that we have seen how a note reference object can switch between
         			 a note's textual content and its reference area we should close the <i>About
            			 the Night Watch</i> item (by clicking on the "X" in its tab) and return our
         			 focus back to the "Night Watch Web Resources" page we created earlier, and then
         			 click on the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/showMap.gif"> toggle button to
         			 change the display of the <i>About the night Watch</i> object back to its
         			 containment mode. Having done this, let us repeat the exercise of grouping the
         			 other two objects (to the web pages about the trials) by choosing them,
         			 grouping them together using the contextual menu's Group Objects option, and
         			 then naming the resulting object to "Trials involving Night Watch". The result
         			 will be:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor11.gif"></p>
      <p>The current design of Pliny only allows it to show you <i>either</i>
         			 a note's the content <i>or</i> its reference area in a reference object. When
         			 it is displaying the note's content the reference object can be called a
         			 <i>content object</i>; when it is displaying the note's reference area it can
         			 be called a <i>containment object</i>. Perhaps in some future version Pliny
         			 will be extended to allow you to see on some way both content and associated
         			 ference area at the same time in a reference object.
      </p>
      <p>Putting references into a containment objects allows the reference
         			 area to be organised both spatially and hierarchically: note "Night Watch Web
         			 References" now has two sub notes called "About the Night Watch" and "Trials
         			 involving Night Watch" and they, in turn, each contain references to two
         			 relevant web pages.
      </p>
      <p>Before we close on this topic, it is important to note that
         			 containment object simply offers a specific way of presenting materials from a
         			 note. There are no "containment notes". Any note can provide a reference object
         			 that can display either the note's textual content or its reference area.
      </p>
      <h3>Managing Containment Objects</h3>
      <p>Although these reference objects are now acting as <i>containment
            			 display</i> rather than <i>content display</i> objects and are displaying
         			 other, nested, reference objects they can, in other senses, act like reference
         			 objects -- they can be moved and resized, renamed, deleted, typed, etc. If they
         			 are moved the objects they contain move with them. Let us make each of the two
         			 objects a little bigger and slightly reposition them on the screen:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor12.gif"></p>
      <p>If after resizing the object is made too small to contain all the
         			 referenced objects Pliny will add a scroll bar to it:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor13.gif"></p>
      <p>Furthermore, items inside the containment box can also be moved
         			 around. As long as they remain inside the containment object then they will
         			 continue to be associated with their container. Let us shift the two objects
         			 down a little inside each container to make the nesting a little more visually
         			 obvious on the screen:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor14.gif"></p>
      <p>Finally, items can be dragged into or out of their container object.
         			 The effect of doing this is to <i>re-parent</i> the item. If, for example, we
         			 dragged the "Before the Bobbies" reference which is currently parented by the
         			 "About the Night Watch" object and placed it between the two containment
         			 objects so that it was in neither of them, it would then be owned by the "Night
         			 Watch Web Reference object". Objects can be dragged into a containment object
         			 from outside (from the Resource Explorer, for example), and will immediately be
         			 contained within the object they end up in.
      </p>
      <p>Note that objects can only be dragged into the reference object when
         			 it is working in its containment mode -- one cannot drag an object A into
         			 another object B when B is operating in content mode.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, since a reference object to any note can display either the
         			 textual content or reference area, one need not necessarily use Pliny's "Group
         			 Object" command to create a containment object. At any time one can click on
         			 the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/showMap.gif"> icon to change a note reference
         			 that was perhaps originally created using the New Note icon
         			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> to a containment object. If it
         			 already has objects in its associated reference area, you will then see them in
         			 the containment object. If the reference area is empty, you can still drag
         			 references into the containment object and re-parent the reference in the way
         			 we described below. There is, in summary, nothing special about the note behind
         			 a containment object . <i>Any</i> note can have reference objects that act as
         			 either containment or content objects.
      </p>
      <h3>Adding a commentary note</h3>
      <p>We are almost done here. After stepping back mentally for a moment,
         			 we decide to add a textual note that sums of the kind of data that we have
         			 collected. We move the two container objects down a little, click on the Note
         			 Editor's New Note icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> -- be sure
         			 to click the one in the note editor pane -- not the one in the Resource
         			 Explorer which, as we have just seen, creates a note but doesn't place it in
         			 any other reference area), and drag out an area into which we want to place the
         			 text. Then we put our commentary note and title into it. In the end we would
         			 have perhaps the screen looking something like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-note-editor15.gif"></p>
      <p>For the moment this note is finished. If we mind more web materials
         			 about the Night Watch we can add references to them here.
      </p>
      <h2>Closing items in the Editor Pane</h2>
      <p>Each time a new object is opened it adds a new tab to the editor pane.
         		  After a little while you will find that the space for tabs will fill up:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-close1.gif"></p>
      <p>... and indeed if you do not close things from time to time the number
         		  of "open items" could be hundreds.
      </p>
      <p>There is more discussion about managing tabs in the help materials
         		  topic <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes</a> which you might want to
         		  consult after you have finished this tutorial. For now it is sufficient to
         		  understand that the tabs identify objects that are currently open in the editor
         		  pane, and the highlighted one is the one you are currently seeing -- the one
         		  that is front (so to speak) in the pile of open objects in the pane. The tab
         		  will contain the name associated with the Pliny resource (truncated if there is
         		  not enough room to see the entire name in the space available). Note the "X" at
         		  the end of the tab. Click in the "X" to close the associated item and remove it
         		  from the editor pane. Although the other tabs will not be showing an "X", you
         		  can make Pliny display one by simply pointing at any of the visible tabs:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-close2.gif"></p>
      <p>You can then click on its "X" to close it without necessarily first
         		  clicking on it to bring it to the front.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, there are tools to close most or all the tabs in one go.
         		  If you open the contextual menu (by clicking on the other mouse button) while
         		  the mouse pointer is in the tab area on the screen you will be presented with
         a
         		  set of "closing" options:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><b>Close</b>: closes the top item (same as clicking on the "X" at
            			 the right end of the tab)
         </li>
         <li><b>Close others</b>: closes all the items except the top item you
            			 are currently looking at.
         </li>
         <li><b>Close all</b>: closes all the items including the top one,
            			 leaving the pane empty.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Making use of Bookmarks</h2>
      <p>We have now completed a Pliny object which helps us to keep track of
         		  web pages we have found that are related to the London Night Watch. One of the
         		  issues we now have to think about is how to keep track of this note itself.
         		  Otherwise, in a week or so it is likely that we will forget what our note is
         		  called, and we will then be unable to readily find it using the Resource
         		  Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>The Resource Explorer has a Bookmarks folder that can be used to help
         		  us keep track of pages like this. It acts a bit like your browser's Favourites
         		  list. You deposit items in it that you wish to use as possible starting points
         		  in the future. Items you deposit in your bookmarks folder will stay in the
         		  folder until you deliberatively delete them from there. You can put as many
         		  items in your bookmarks list as you like -- although you will usually find that
         		  if you have more than, say, 20 or so that the list becomes unwieldy. We'll
         		  discuss what to do when you have more than 20 important topics on the go in
         		  Pliny at one time shortly.
      </p>
      <p>We currently have our page Night Watch Web References that we wish to
         		  add to our bookmark list. First we must locate it in the Resource Explorer.
         		  When we find it there and select it, and we click on the other mouse button to
         		  get the contextual menu we will see an option "Add to Bookmarks":
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-5.gif"></p>
      <p>We choose this to ask Pliny to do this for us. After we have done that
         		  we will note that a reference to this note has been put in the My Bookmarks
         		  folder as shown by the Resource Explorer:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/browser-tut-6.gif"></p>
      <p>We have just used the contextual menu in the Resource Explorer to add
         		  an item as a new Bookmark. There are other ways to do this, however: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>Any Pliny resource can be dragged and dropped onto the "My
               			 Bookmarks" folder item in the Resource Explorer to add it.
            </li>
            <li>When a new note is being created using the Resource Explorer's New
               			 Note button (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">) one has the choice
               			 while filling in the New Note wizard screen to tick the box beside the option
               			 "Add to bookmark list?" If this item is ticked, then when Pliny creates the new
               			 note from this wizard it also adds it to the My Bookmarks list at the same
               			 time.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Dealing with Dynamic Content</h2>
      <p>The web is well known as a very dynamic place. A web page you look at
         		  today might not be there tomorrow, and even if it is, its content might be
         		  changed. Furthermore, URLs can change from time to time -- when you click on
         		  what looks like the same link on one page to go to another destination page
         		  there is no guarantee that the new page will have the same URL today as it had
         		  yesterday -- even if the destination page's contents look the same.
      </p>
      <p>Pliny identifies pages solely by their URL. It thinks it is visiting
         		  the same page when it's browser is given the URL it has recorded as associated
         		  with that page. There are three situations, then, where the assocation between
         		  the webpage and the notes you formally linked to it is a problem: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><b>The page has disappeared</b>: If the web reports that there is
               			 no page available for a given URL, the browser will display an error message to
               			 you. The notes you previously linked to that page, however, will still appear
               			 -- although they will no appear to be linked to the error message the browser
               			 generates when it cannot find a page associated with the URL rather than the
               			 original page.
            </li>
            <li><b>The page content has changed</b>: It is possible that the
               			 contents of a page may be enough changed that the notes you linked to its old
               			 version are no longer relevant. The only answer here is, of course to mutter
               			 "<i>c'est la vie</i>" under your breath while acknowledging that web pages are
               			 like that; and perhaps to alter your associated notes, or add new ones.
            </li>
            <li><b>The page has moved</b>: If the web first reports that your page
               			 is not there, but you subsequently find a new URL that opens to a page with the
               			 same material that your old page had, you can update the URL stored with the
               			 web-page resource to point to this new page instead. Do this by: 
               			 
               <ul>
                  <li>Locating the web-page resource item in the Resource Explorer,
                     				  and click on it to select it.
                  </li>
                  <li>Use the other mouse button to open the contextul menu (on a
                     				  one-button Macintosh mouse, hold down the Control key while clicking to open
                     				  the contextual menu).
                  </li>
                  <li>Choose the item "Update resource's URL"</li>
                  <li>A dialog box will appear showing you the URL that is currently
                     				  associated with the page. Change the URL in the dialog box to the new URL, and
                     				  click the OK button.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The dynamic nature of the web is known to be a problem for scholarship
         		  because a web page needs to be available well after the first scholarly
         		  reference to it. Many libraries and digital archives recognise this problem and
         		  know that a reference to a particular page of theirs is likely to be via its
         		  URL. As a result, they intend to provide URL stability for their pages -- once
         		  a URL appears under these libraries or archives in public it and its content
         		  will not change again.
      </p>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
      <p>This has been a long introduction to how to use Pliny but it has
         		  touched upon a number of key topics: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>How to start up the web browser, and what you see when you do.</li>
            <li>How to create notes in the web page's associated reference area,
               			 and how to work in the reference area to manage your notes once you have some
               			 in it.
            </li>
            <li>How the Resource Explorer works to track all Pliny resources you
               			 have created.
            </li>
            <li>How you would use the Explorer's New Note button to create a note
               			 whose job it is is to manage references to other objects such as web
               			 pages.
            </li>
            <li>How to use the Note editor to work with a note's textual content
               			 and associated reference area
            </li>
            <li>How to use containment objects to organize materials</li>
            <li>The relationship between notes/web pages, their content, and their
               			 associated reference area
            </li>
            <li>How to use the Bookmarks feature to provide starting points to
               			 materials you have stored in Pliny
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Since the WWW is such an important resource for information nowadays,
         		  this first tutorial explored how to work with it in Pliny. However, not all
         		  resources one might want to work with are represented as web pages. In the next
         		  tutorial <a href="tut.nonDigital.html">Using Pliny with Non-digital
            		  Materials</a> we start over again showing how you would use Pliny's notes to
         		  collect and organise materials you record while reading a non-digital object:
         		  an article printed on paper. Although it covers some ground we have just
         		  covered above over again, it adds some new mechanisms (such as Pliny's
         		  "Referent" process) that helps with organising materials recorded from paper.
         		  If you have not already done so, however, this might be a good time to review
         		  the material in the section <a href="getting.started.html">Getting started with
            		  Pliny</a> which gives you an overview of the areas of the Pliny screen
         		  (toolbars and panes in particular) and how Pliny manages this area.
         		  Alternatively, if you'd rather read a different tutorial right now (for
         		  example, the ones to allow you to annotate images or PDF files, go to the
         		  <a href="tut.tutorialIndex.html">tutorial table of contents</a> page to help
         		  find them.
