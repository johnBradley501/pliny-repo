      <h1><a name="d1e92">1.1 Pliny and Eclipse</a></h1>
      <p>Pliny operates within the Eclipse environment, so it is useful to
         		understand the way Eclipse organises and uses screen areas, since Pliny
         		inherits these mechanisms in the way that it manages them too. 
         	 
         <ul>
            <li>See the material in section <a href="intro.uiBasics.html">Eclipse UI
                  		  Basics</a> for an introduction to how Eclipse applications such as Pliny use
               		  the screen.
            </li>
            <li>There is also a section (<a href="intro.toolbars.html">here</a>)
               		  describing the way <i>toolbars</i> operate in Eclipse, and
            </li>
            <li>how <i>panes</i> work (<a href="intro.panes.html">here</a>).
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Part of the point of situating Pliny in Eclipse is to take advantage of
         		Eclipse's plugin model. The plugin approach to tool building provides a rich
         		framework in which interactions between independantly developed tools can be
         		formally expressed and implemented. There has been an expressed desire for many
         		years within humanities computing for tools that can work together. With
         		Eclipse's plugin framework we have a context to make this possible, and
         		furthermore in ways that go beyond the relatively simple "shared files"
         		approach that has been, up-till-now, the limits of what many of those in HC
         		have thought about. The Plugin approach for building tools within Eclipse would
         		be helpful for two reasons: 
         	 
         <ul>
            <li>All the separately developed plugins will share the same interface
               		  strategy that Eclipse provides. Of course, the various objects provided by
               		  different plugins will provide different functions, and the user will have to
               		  understand what they do, but other common aspects of their function will be the
               		  same for different plugins, and managed by Eclipse.
            </li>
            <li>Eclipse provides an enriched modle for connections between plugins,
               		  allowing a sense of co-operation between separate components what is
               		  unparalleled in non-plugin architectures.
            </li>
         </ul>
