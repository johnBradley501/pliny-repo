      <h1><a name="d1e3612">2.1.2 Image Annotator</a></h1>
      <p>This section provides a reference section for the Pliny's image
         		annotator. If you are unfamiliar with how to use the image annotator within
         		Pliny, you might wish to see <a href="tut.plinyWithImages.html">the tutorial on
            		this subject</a>. 
      </p>
      <h2>What's it for</h2>
      <p>The Image Annotator can be used whenever you wish to annotate an
         		  image. It will launch in the large central "working are" in the Pliny
         		  window.
      </p>
      <h2>Importing an Image</h2>
      <p>An image must be imported into the Pliny system before it can be
         		  annotated. The importing process does two things: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>It caches a copy of the image in Pliny's own storage area. Pliny
               			 always uses the image in its cache whenever it shows it to you.
            </li>
            <li>It creates an image resource which is Pliny's way of addressing the
               			 image itself.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You import the image by dragging a reference to it, or from a web page
         		  containing the image and dropping it on the Image folder in the Resource
         		  Explorer:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-import.png"></p>
      <p>This invokes the image importer which does somewhat different things
         		  depending upon which of the three kinds of sources you give it.
      </p>
      <h3>Importing from an Image FIle</h3>
      <p>If you drag an image icon from the folders representing your
         			 machine's storage onto the Image folder, the following things happen: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>The image is cached.</li>
            <li>A Pliny resource for the image is created.</li>
            <li>The resource is given a name based on the filename of the image.
               				You will probably want to change the resource's name.
            </li>
            <li>The image annotator opens.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You are now ready to start annotating the image.</p>
      <h3>Importing from a Web Page</h3>
      <p>You can request the importing of an image from a web page in three
         			 ways: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>When looking at the web page in Pliny's embedded browser you can
               				either click the Image button (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/imageIcon.gif">)
               				or drag the drag source to the Image folder in the Resource Explorer:
               				
               <p align="center"><img src="images/image-import-browser.png"></p>
            </li>
            <li>When viewing a web page in an external browser you can drag the
               				icon because the URL in the location field to the Image folder in the Resource
               				Explorer:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-2.png"></p>
            </li>
            <li>If you have either the HTML page or a shortcut to it on your hard
               				disk you may drag it's icon to the Image folder in the Resource Explorer:
               				
               <p align="center"><img src="images/image-import-file.png"></p>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>What the importer does in all these cases is the same: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>Suitable images (images larger than 150x150 pixels) are each
               				treated as potentially separate image resources. If two or more candidates are
               				found, Pliny asks you which ones you wish to import:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/image-tut-1a.png"></p> 
               				
               <p>Click on the "Include?" check box to ask for an image to be
                  				  included. After you have finished choosing items, and you click on the "OK"
                  				  button, each selected image is then cached.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>For each selected image a Pliny image resource is created. It is
               				given a name derived from the title of the web page.
            </li>
            <li>A web page resource for the source web page is created if it does
               				not already exist, and a reference to it is put on the image(s). It is given a
               				name derived from the title of the web page.
            </li>
            <li>A note resource is created from the text found on the web page,
               				and a reference to it is put on the image(s). It is given a name derived from
               				the title of the web page.
            </li>
            <li>Each image created in this way is opened in the Editor pane.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Importing an image from a web page</h3>
      <p>You can import a single image from a web page by pointing the mouse
         			 pointer at the image and dragging it to the Image folder in the Resource
         			 Explorer. In this case the importer will: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>Cache the image</li>
            <li>Create a Pliny image resource referring to this image.</li>
            <li>Name the resource according to the URL for the image. You will
               				probably wish to edit the name.
            </li>
            <li>Open the image in the image annotator.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Screen components</h2>
      <p>Here is a typical display of the Image Annotator, with its parts
         		  labelled:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-parts.png"></p>
      <p>The Image annotator has four major areas that appear on the screen: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>As for all objects that appear in Pliny's main working area, a tab
               			 shows above the editor pane, and identifies the image. The name showing there
               			 comes from the name of the image resource. If you wish to change the name of
               			 the resource you can do so by editing it in the Image Resource Name field, or
               			 in the <a href="ref.resourceExplorer.html">Resource Explorer</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Below the tab is the main working area (called elsewhere the Pliny
               			 toolbar because all of Pliny's annotation and notetaking tools have it). It
               			 contains (left to right): 
               			 
               <ul>
                  <li>this image's "Drag and Drop Object" (this is described
                     				  below).
                  </li>
                  <li>a field in which the image resource's name is shown (here
                     				  labelled "Image Resource Name") -- change the name by editing the field, 
                  </li>
                  <li>A working toolbar area provides a set of tools that you can use
                     				  to create objects in the annotation area. For more information about it, see
                     				  the description below.
                  </li>
                  <li>a "spinner" labelled "Image Size Control" in the figure above
                     				  which is used to control the displayed size of the image -- click on the
                     				  spinner's up or down arrows, or type in a value (between 10 and 100) to change
                     				  the size of the image's display (this described immediately below),
                  </li>
               </ul> 
            </li>
            <li>Below this area, and the main working area in the pane, is the
               			 <i>Annotation Area</i>. Here the image appears, and the annotations attached to
               			 it can be created and edited. It works in a way that is very similar to the
               			 Note Editor's and embedded Web Browser's <i>Reference Area</i> except that the
               			 annotation and note materials appear combined with the image they belong to.
               			 There is more about the Annotation Area and how to work in it in
               			 <a href="ref.annotationArea.html">its description</a>.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>The Image Size Spinner</h3>
      <p>The image size control appears as a "spinner", shown here:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-size-spinner.gif"></p>
      <p>The number in the spinner shows the size (as a percentage) of the
         			 image showing vs the full size of the image. The number showing here ("15")
         			 should be read, then, that the image showing below is shrunk to 15% of the full
         			 size of the image. To change the size of the image you can either replace the
         			 number showing with a different number by clicking into the box and typing in
         			 the new number (values 10 to 100 for 10% to 100% can be set). You can also
         			 change the number by clicking (and perhaps holding) on the up arrow or down
         			 arrow buttons to the right size of the spinner. Note that the image size will
         			 not actually change until you <i>release</i> the up or down arrow.
      </p>
      <h2>ToolBar</h2>
      <p>The toolbar for the Image Annotator (which Eclipse places in the main
         		  toolbar area) contains tools that work with the Annotator. Most of them are
         		  used with the Annotation Area and allow things to be done within it. The
         		  toolbar for the Image Annotator looks like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-toolbar.png"></p>
      <ul>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/referencersOn.gif">: Use this icon by
            			 clicking on the down arrow symbol (<img align="middle" src="images/pull-down.gif">) to
            			 its right rather than the icon itself. Clicking the down-arrow will cause Pliny
            			 to generate a list of all resources managed by Pliny that refer to the current
            			 image. To open one of these resources, choose it from the list.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/undo.gif">: This icon allows you to
            			 undo the previous action you have done in the Annotation area. Undo can also be
            			 chosen from the "Edit" menu, or requested using the standard keystroke for your
            			 platform.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/redo.gif">: This icon allows you to
            			 redo an action you have just undone in the Annotation area. Redo is also
            			 available from the "Edit" menu, or can be requested by the standard keystroke
            			 for redo.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">: This icon allows you
            			 to create a new note and a note reference for it that will appear in the
            			 Annotation area. You can use it in two ways: 
            			 
            <ol>
               <li>first click on the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
                  				  button, then in the annotation area drag over the area there that you wish to
                  				  be used for the space the reference is to occupy, or
               </li>
               <li>you can drag the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
                  				  button itself into the annotation area. This will give you a "standard size"
                  				  note which you can later change its size.
               </li>
            </ol> After Pliny has responded and created a reference and new note
            			 for you, you will want to type in the note name and its text in the newly
            			 created space. Each time a new note is created the "create new note" state is
            			 cleared, and you must push the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
            			 again to create another note or drag a new note from the
            			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> button. There is a keyboard
            			 shortcut that puts Pliny in "create new note" state as well: F5).
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/annotationIcon.gif">: This icon
            			 creates a full annotation for you. An annotation consists of a note, a
            			 reference to the note (on this image), an anchor the note refers to and a
            			 connection line between them. To use it, first click on the
            			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/annotationIcon.gif"> button, then drag over the
            			 area over the image where you wish the anchor to be placed. Pliny will respoind
            			 by creating the anchor, a note and note reference and a linking line. You can
            			 then type in the note title and text in the newly created reference and can
            			 move the note to another place on the screen if you wish. Each time a new
            			 annotation is created the "create new annotation" state is cleared, and you
            			 must push the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/annotationIcon.gif"> again to
            			 create another annotation. The annotation button is a convenience only -- using
            			 it is exactly equivalent to using the anchor button (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/anchorIcon.gif">) to create the anchor, the note button
            			 (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">) and the connection button
            			 (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">) to join them together. The
            			 keyboard shortcut for this function is F7.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/anchorIcon.gif">: This icon creates
            			 an anchor area for you. To use it first click on the
            			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/anchorIcon.gif"> as a button, then in the
            			 annotation area drag out the area where you wish the anchor to appear. Pliny
            			 will respond by creating the anchor for you. Each time a new anchor is created
            			 the "create new anchor" state is cleared and you must push the
            			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/anchorIcon.gif"> again to create another anchor.
            			 The keyboard shortcut for this is F8.
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">: This icon
            			 allows you to create a connection between two objects that appear in the
            			 annotation area (a line joining them). A connection is usually used to
            			 represent some sort of conceptual connection between the two items.. To
            			 establish a connection line first click on the
            			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">, then click in the reference
            			 or anchor that should hold the start of the line, and drag to the reference or
            			 anchor where the line should end. Each time you wish to create a new connection
            			 you must first push the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">
            			 again. The keyboard shortcut for this function is F6
         </li>
         <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/allClose.gif">: Click on this icon to
            			 cause all the references in this reference area to be minimized.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
      <p>An important element of Pliny's design was in the work involved in
         		  trying to make the creation of notes and annotations as straight-forward as
         		  possible. To this end we have added various drag and drop features to Pliny. Of
         		  course, references or anchors can be dragged about in a image's annotation area
         		  -- that is how you make use of the 2D space the annotation area provided to
         		  organise the notes. However, drag and drop can also be used to copy materials
         		  from outside the image annotator into it, or from inside the image annotator to
         		  other areas. Here is a summary of these drag and drop features available in the
         		  annotator:
      </p>
      <h3><i>Into</i> the Annotator
      </h3>
      <p>Here are the kind of things that can be dragged from elsewhere into
         			 the annotation area: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>A reference to any resource can be dragged from the Resource
               				Explorer to the 2D annotation area. Pliny will interpret this as a request to
               				create a reference to that resource there. A reference to a note in the Note
               				Search View works the same way.
            </li>
            <li>If you have more than one editor open at the same time you can
               				drag a reference from one into the other by dragging the reference's <i>drag
                  				source object</i>. See the figure in the section <i>Out of the Annotator</i> to
               				see where the drag source objects are.
            </li>
            <li>Text can be selected from another program that supports Drag and
               				Drop (such as Word) outside of Pliny and dragged onto the annotation area.
               				Pliny will interpret this as a request to create a note and a reference to it
               				in the area. If the dragged text begins with a short line of text that looks
               				like a heading, Pliny will interpret this as the note's title.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3><i>Out of </i>the Annotator
      </h3>
      <p>Like the other editors in Pliny the annotator provides a <b>drag
            			 source object</b> for its <i>own</i> image resource in the top left area in its
         			 Pliny toolbar:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-dnd-object.png"></p>
      <p> If you wish to create a reference to this particular image resource
         			 within another resource you can drag this object to the place you wish it to
         			 appear, or you can locate the source image resource in the Resource Explorer
         			 and drag it from there.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the image annotator has an annotation area, and
         			 references contained in that area can be dragged to the annotation or reference
         			 areas of other resources by dragging the drag source object in the reference.
         			 Here is an example:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/image-dnd.gif"></p>
      <p>Here we see Pliny displaying a note at the bottom and an image at
         			 the top (the help section "Dividing a Pane: docking" in the topic
         			 <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes</a> describes how to split the Pliny
         			 window in this way). Suppose that the user wishes to add a reference to the
         			 "Leaf Motif" note in the image to the "Leaf Motif: About" note at the bottom.
         			 To do this the user should point the mouse pointer at the Leaf Motif reference
         			 object's drag source object in the top area and drag it to the bottom area.
         			 When the mouse bottom is released Pliny will create a new reference to the same
         			 object here. <b>Note</b> that dragging between notes will <i>only</i> work when
         			 one points at the specific drag source object -- here the
         			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">icon in the Note's reference
         			 object. If one points elsewhere in the reference's object Pliny will <i>not</i>
         			 understand it as a start of a request to drag a reference from one note to
         			 another -- it will see it as a request to move the object in its current
         			 reference space.
