      <h1><a name="d1e4614">2.1.6 Annotation View</a></h1>
      <h2>What's it for?</h2>
      <p>The Annotation view provides a reference area that can be attached to
         		  applications in Eclipse that are not Pliny aware. The view tracks the current
         		  active editor and the object (usually, in Eclipse, the document) it is editing
         		  and creates a Pliny resource that refers to that editor/object combination. It
         		  then displays a reference area into which you can store references to Pliny
         		  notes. (see the discussion about the <a href="ref.annotationArea.html">reference
            		  area</a> for more details). Each time you return to the same editor/object
         		  combination while using Eclipse the Annotation View will note this and bring
         		  back the associated reference area that it was displaying last time you were
         		  working on this document. <i>Note</i>: if you only use Pliny aware editors
         		  (such as those you find in the "standalone" version of Pliny) then you will not
         		  need the Annotation View, since all the editors you are using will have already
         		  provided a place to attach annotations.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, since the view creates a Pliny resource that is linked to
         		  each particular editor/object combination then the resource will appear in the
         		  Resource Explorer. You can reopen the editor/object from there.
      </p>
      <p><i>Note</i> that although the Annotation View tracks all editor/object
         		  combinations including Pliny editors and objects, it will not show a reference
         		  area for Pliny editors since they provide their own reference or annotation
         		  area already. As noted above, the Annotation View is really intended to be used
         		  when Pliny is not being used in its standalone version, but instead has been
         		  installed into a full version of Eclipse, or a simpler environment, and it is
         		  useful with non-Pliny aware editors only. The Annotation View will not be very
         		  useful if you are using Pliny in its standalone application format (rather than
         		  as an Eclipse plugin), since only Pliny-aware editors are available to you
         		  there.
      </p>
      <h2>Starting the Annotation View</h2>
      <p>To start the Annotation view click on its icon in the main
         		  toolbar:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/av-ref-1.gif"></p>
      <p>It will launch itself in a view pane. If you are using the Pliny
         		  perspective at the time, this view pane will be to the right of the editor
         		  window.
      </p>
      <p>Once launched the Annotation View will track the current active editor
         		  and object. Each time you change to a new object in the main editor window the
         		  Annotation View will open a different reference area for it. Since the
         		  Annotation View tracks the current editor/object, it is not possible to have
         		  the view display two reference areas at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>You can close the Annotation View at any time by clicking in the "X"
         		  in its tab item at the top of the pane that contains it.
      </p>
      <p><i>Note</i> that the Pliny reference to the editor/object pair is
         		  first created when the first object is put in the associated reference
         		  area.
      </p>
      <h2>Commands</h2>
      <p>The Annotation View provides a reference area, and the commands
         		  available in the view correspond to those available in any reference area. See
         		  the <a href="ref.annotationArea.html">reference area</a> section of this
         		  documentation for more details.
