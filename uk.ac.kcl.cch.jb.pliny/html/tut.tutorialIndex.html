      <h1><a name="d1e672">1.2 Pliny Tutorials</a></h1>
      <p>Here you will find some tutorials that introduce you to how to use Pliny
         		to support note taking and organisation. Pliny is likely to be unlike other
         		software with which you are familiar, and we recommend that you read over one
         		or more of them before you begin to use Pliny in your work.
      </p>
      <p>It is likely that you will think initially of Pliny as an annotation
         		tool: as a way to attach personal comments to materials that you are reading,
         		and, indeed the first 4 tutorials focus on how to use Pliny with different
         		digital (and non-digital) materials to do just this. However, Pliny is capable
         		of doing more than managing annotations. What are personal annotations for?
         		There is evidence to suggest that most people annotate as a kind of notetaking,
         		and use their annotations/notes as a tool to better fix ideas that come to them
         		as they read. However, in the end, personal notes and annotations are only
         		useful if they feed into and help support a personal interpretation of the
         		materials you are reading. The first four tutorials, then, start off focussing
         		on annotationg of digital objects in Pliny, starting with web pages, then on to
         		non-digital items (where the act is more like notetaking), then on pages and on
         		PDF files. Having covered that, however, in these first four tutorials, the
         		remaining two turn the focus from annotation creation to the use of annotations
         		and other mechanisms in Pliny to assist you in the creation of a kind of
         		interpretative framework for yourself of these materials.
      </p>
      <p>The tutorials are as follows: 
         	 
         <ul>
            <li><a href="tut.plinyWithWeb.html">using Pliny with Web-based
                  		  materials</a>: presents an introduction to using Pliny to collect notes
               		  derived from Web-based materials, with thoughts about how to manage them. Pliny
               		  provides a useful way to intergrate notes you make about materials on web pages
               		  with the pages themselves, and this tutorial introduces the main concepts you
               		  will need to understand in order to use Pliny in this way.
            </li>
            <li><a href="tut.nonDigital.html">using Pliny with non-digital
                  		  materials</a>: presents an introduction to how to use Pliny to manage notes
               		  you gather from non-digital materials such as printed books, and also
               		  introduces you to some of the strategies you can use in Pliny to organise and
               		  manage the notes that you have created.
            </li>
            <li><a href="tut.plinyWithImages.html">using Pliny with Images</a>:
               		  describes how to use Pliny's image annotator to work with images. It assumes
               		  that you have already read one or both of the previous tutorials.
            </li>
            <li><a href="tut.pdfAnnotator.html">using Pliny with PDF (Acrobat)
                  		  files</a>: describes how to use Pliny's PDF annotator to work with PDF
               		  (Acrobat) files. It also assumes that you have already read one or both of the
               		  previous tutorials.
            </li>
            <li><a href="tut.organisingNotes.html">using Pliny to organise notes</a>:
               		  introduces to how to use Pliny to organise notes in ways that begin to move
               		  towards the development of a conceptual model for your materials.
            </li>
            <li><a href="tut.managingMaterials.html">managing Pliny materials</a>:
               		  introduces some strategies that you can use in Pliny to manage your growing
               		  collection of materials effectively.
