      <h1><a name="d1e4110">2.1.4 Note Editor</a></h1>
      <h2>What's it for</h2>
      <p>The Note Editor is invoked by Pliny whenever you wish to change the
         		  content of a Note. It is an editor, so it will launch an editing space for the
         		  note it is allowing you to edit in the editor pane.
      </p>
      <p>Notes are a key element in more than one way in Pliny. You can seetwo
         		  ways to use notes be looking at two tutorials: <a href="tut.nonDigital.html">using
            		  Pliny with non-digital materials</a>, and <a href="tut.organisingNotes.html">using Pliny to organise notes</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Screen components</h2>
      <p>Here is a typical display of the Note Editor, with its parts
         		  labelled:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/noteEditor-1.png"></p>
      <h3>Tab</h3>
      <p>Tabs appear at the top of the editor pane. The highlighted one (in
         			 the figure, "Wittig 1978") belongs to the main screen area below. The "X" icon
         			 can be clicked on to close the object.
      </p>
      <h3>Boundary</h3>
      <p>All notes have two major components, content and reference, and they
         			 are displayed side-by-side in the Note Editor. The Reference area is separated
         			 from the Content areas by a boundary. Drag the boundary area left or right to
         			 change the proportion of screen are given to the two portions.
      </p>
      <h3>Title</h3>
      <p>In Pliny, all references, including Notes, have a title. The title
         			 of the current note appears here and can be edited by clicking in the title
         			 area. If the title is too long to appear in the window the area will roll
         			 left/right to give access to the entire title. After you have finished editing
         			 the text you needn't do anything, but if you want to explicitly close the
         			 editing space so that you can see the effect, click somewhere out of the
         			 editing space when done.
      </p>
      <h3>Content</h3>
      <p>The content area contains the text associated with the Note. To edit
         			 the content click in the text in the content area. After you have finished
         			 editing the text you needn't do anything, but if you want to explicitly close
         			 the editing space, click somewhere out of the editing space when done.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, no formatting facilities for the text in the content
         			 area are provided in Pliny. Since notes are generally likely to be relatively
         			 short (if they are long then they will have structure that means that they
         			 should perhaps be divided into separate notes). If you wish to introduce markup
         			 for formatting I suggest that you use a scheme similar to that used to be
         			 provided in older Wiki software: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>leave a blank line between paragraphs</li>
            <li>Start bulletted list items with a "*", leaving a space after the
               				*-bullet.
            </li>
            <li>Number numbered list items in the format 1., 2. etc. leaving a
               				space after the number-point combination.
            </li>
            <li>Mark text that should be in italics by surrounding them with an
               				underline: <tt>_this is in italics_</tt>.
            </li>
            <li>Mark text that should be in bold by surrounding it with an
               				asterisk <tt>*this should be in bold*</tt>.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Reference Area</h3>
      <p>This is the area where references to other Pliny resources are
         			 displayed. The Reference area provides a working 2D space for laying out the
         			 <a href="ref.referenceObject.html">reference objects</a>. There is more about
         			 the Reference area <a href="ref.referenceObject.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Drag Source Object</h3>
      <p>The <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> that appears to the
         			 left of the title can be used in drag and drop objects as a drag source. If you
         			 wish to include a reference to this open note in another reference object's
         			 reference area, you can take drag this object into the reference area of the
         			 other object and Pliny will create a reference object for you there. See the
         			 section below on Drag and Drop in the material about the Note Editor (below)
         			 for more details.
      </p>
      <h2>ToolBar</h2>
      <p>The toolbar for the Note Editor (which Eclipse places in the main
         		  toolbar area) contains tools that work with the Note Editor. Most of them are
         		  used with the Reference Area and allow things to be done within it. The toolbar
         		  for the Note Editor looks like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/noteEditor-2.png"></p>
      <p>The tools and their icons are: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/referencersOn.gif">: Use this icon by
               			 clicking on the down arrow symbol (<img align="middle" src="images/pull-down.gif">) to
               			 its right rather than the icon itself. Clicking the down-arrow will cause Pliny
               			 to generate a list of all resources managed by Pliny that refer to the current
               			 note. To open one of these resources, choose it from the list.
            </li>
            <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/undo.gif">: This icon allows you to
               			 undo the previous action you have done in the Reference area. Undo can also be
               			 chosen from the "Edit" menu, or requested using the standard keystroke for your
               			 platform.
            </li>
            <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/redo.gif">: This icon allows you to
               			 redo an action you have just undone in the Reference area. Redo is also
               			 available from the "Edit" menu, or can be requested by the standard keystroke
               			 for redo.
            </li>
            <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">: This icon allows you
               			 to create a new note and a note reference for it that will appear in the
               			 Annotation area. You can use it in two ways: 
               			 
               <ol>
                  <li>first click on the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
                     				  button, then in the annotation area drag over the area there that you wish to
                     				  be used for the space the reference is to occupy, or
                  </li>
                  <li>you can drag the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
                     				  button itself into the annotation area. This will give you a "standard size"
                     				  note which you can later change its size.
                  </li>
               </ol> After Pliny has responded and created a reference and new note
               			 for you, you will want to type in the note name and its text in the newly
               			 created space. Each time a new note is created the "create new note" state is
               			 cleared, and you must push the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif">
               			 again to create another note or drag a new note from the
               			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> button. There is a keyboard
               			 shortcut that puts Pliny in "create new note" state as well: F5).
            </li>
            <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">: This icon
               			 allows you to create a connection between two references (a line joining them).
               			 A connection is usually used to represent some sort of conceptual connection
               			 between the two items.. To establish a connection line first click on the
               			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif">, then click in the reference
               			 that should hold the start of the line, and drag to the reference where the
               			 line should end. Each time you wish to create a new connection you must first
               			 push the <img align="middle" src="images/icons/connectionIcon.gif"> again. The keyboard
               			 shortcut for this is F6.
            </li>
            <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/allClose.gif">: Click on this icon to
               			 cause all the references in this reference area to be minimized.
            </li>
            <li><img align="middle" src="images/icons/saveFile.gif">: Click on this icon to
               			 write the contents and reference area of this note to an HTML file. This tool,
               			 which is even more experimental than the rest of Pliny, implements some first
               			 thoughts about how one could take the reference area of a note (which is
               			 essentially a 2-D area) and map it into a text which is essentially 1-D. See
               			 more about this tool in section<i> The Note Editor's Text-generation Tool</i>
               			 (below).
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
      <p>An important element of Pliny's design was in the work involved in
         		  trying to make the creation of notes as straight-forward as possible. To this
         		  end we have added various drag and drop features to Pliny. Of course,
         		  references can be dragged about in a note's reference area -- that is how you
         		  make use of the 2D space the reference area provided to organise the notes.
         		  However, drag and drop can also be used to copy materials from outside the note
         		  editor into it, or from inside the note area to other areas. Here is a summary
         		  of these drag and drop features available in the Note Editor:
      </p>
      <h3><i>Into</i> the note Editor
      </h3>
      <p>Here are the kind of things that can be dragged from elsewhere into
         			 the note editor's reference area: 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>A reference to any resource can be dragged from the Resource
               				Explorer to the 2D reference area. Pliny will interpret this as a request to
               				create a reference to that resource there. A reference to a note in the Note
               				Search View works the same way.
            </li>
            <li>If you have more than one editor open at the same time you can
               				drag a reference from one into the other by dragging the reference's <i>drag
                  				source object</i>. See the figure in the section <i>Out of the Note Editor</i>
               				to see where the drag source objects are.
            </li>
            <li>Text can be selected from another program that supports Drag and
               				Drop (such as Word) outside of Pliny and dragged onto the reference area of a
               				Pliny note. Pliny will interpret this as a request to create a note and a
               				reference to it in the area. If the dragged text begins with a short line of
               				text that looks like a heading, Pliny will interpret this as the note's
               				title.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3><i>Out of </i>the note Editor
      </h3>
      <p>The note editor provides two kinds of drag source objects that can
         			 be dragged from the note editor into another Pliny object. The following figure
         			 shows them:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/dnd-noteEditor.png"></p>
      <p>Here we see Pliny displaying two notes (the help section "Dividing a
         			 Pane: docking" in the topic <a href="intro.panes.html">Managing Panes</a>
         			 describes how to split the Pliny window in this way). The top part contains the
         			 note "History of Computing" and the bottom is displaying "Ethnography &amp;
         			 History". A Pliny user can use one of the two drag source objects shown to make
         			 a reference from something in one note to the other. 
         		  
         <ul>
            <li>If the user wanted to insert a reference to "Ethnography &amp;
               				History" in his/her "History of Computing" note, he should point at the drag
               				source object belonging to the "Ethnography &amp; History" note (of the two
               				marked in the figure above, this is the one to the left), and drag it into the
               				reference area of the other note. Pliny will respond during the drag by showing
               				you a grey box similar to that shown in the figure above. When you have placed
               				the reference where you want it release the mouse button.
            </li>
            <li>If the user wanted to insert a reference to one of the objects in
               				"Ethnography &amp; History"'s references this can also be done. Suppose the
               				reference to "Ethnography + historiography" was to be copied. Its drag source
               				object is in its reference display at the left end (see it highlighted above).
               				Point the mouse pointer at it and drag that object to a place in the receiving
               				note's reference area. <b>Note</b> that dragging between notes will <i>only</i>
               				work when one points at the specific drag source object. If one points
               				elsewhere in the references area Pliny will <i>not</i> understand it as a start
               				of a request to drag a reference from one note to another -- it will see it as
               				a request to move the object in its current reference space.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>The Note Editor's Text-generation Tool</h2>
      <p>Pliny is meant to help you organise materials in ways that represent
         		  issues of interest to you. When you have something that you wish to describe to
         		  others you are likely to want to write an article about it. Pliny can be useful
         		  in the article-creation process -- one can create a note which represents the
         		  eventual article itself, and then use its reference area to bring to together
         		  ideas that you think should appear in the article, and you can use the 2D
         		  reference area itself, and connections bewteen the references to help you sort
         		  out the relationships between the ideas represented by the materials you have
         		  assembled. However, turning this into an artiple still involves some
         		  significant amount of further work.
      </p>
      <p>Pliny does not do this conversion for you, but you can use a Note's
         		  generating text tool to get all the notes you have assembled relative to this
         		  article out into a single text file. From there you could use a word processor
         		  to reorganise the notes and work on the text they contain until an article
         		  appears.
      </p>
      <p><b>Note</b>: This tool is even more experimental than the rest of
         		  Pliny and is likely to evolve considerably over time or perhaps be entirely
         		  replaced by something better.
      </p>
      <h3>Steps to use the Tool</h3>
      <p>To use the text generation tool, first click on the
         			 <img align="middle" src="images/icons/saveFile.gif"> tool you find in the Note Editor's
         			 toolbar. The following things will happen: 
         			 
         <ul>
            <li>Pliny will present you with your operating system's standard
               				  create file dialog box. Choose a directory to receive the file and name it here
               				  in the way that you normally would any time this box appears, and click on the
               				  'save' button (or choose 'cancel' to cancel). Note that the output Pliny
               				  creates will be an HTML file.
            </li>
            <li>If a file with the name you give already exists in the
               				  directory you have chosen, Pliny will ask you if you wish to replace it --
               				  choose 'yes' to continue, or 'no' to cancel.
            </li>
            <li>Pliny will present you with the Text-generation tool's wizard
               				  which allows you to control options for the textual generation. We will expand
               				  this section of the documentation soon to provide a description of the options.
               				  When done here, push 'finish' to close the wizard and start the file generation
               				  process.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>What's in the generated file, and what can you do with
         			 it?
      </h3>
      <p>The generated HTML file will not be very pretty! It is not, after
         			 all, a finished text -- but simply a kind of dump of notes and references to
         			 other Pliny objects into a text file. As such, the result is really meant to
         			 act merely as a <i>starting point</i> from which article text can be more
         			 conveniently written. The file begins with the note that is currently open, and
         			 displays first its textual content. Then, it displays a list of items -- one
         			 for each resource referenced on the main note's reference area. The contents of
         			 the item are organised by sorting the items first vertically (so that objects
         			 near the top of the reference area come out first), and then horizontally, so
         			 that objects <i>exactly</i> side by side appear with the one to the left
         			 appearing first. Options are provided to allow for a recursive generation -- to
         			 display the reference area of resources referenced on the main note's reference
         			 area, and so on potentially as many levels as the system can find. These
         			 secondary references will appear indented within the list of items in the
         			 generated file.
      </p>
      <p>You can certainly view this file in a browser, and perhaps cut and
         			 paste materials from there into your word processor. With many versions of
         			 Microsoft Word, and perhaps with other word processors too, you can ask them to
         			 open the HTML file directly (the action might be different depending upon
         			 whether you have asked Pliny to create it as an XHTML file or not -- try them
         			 both to see which you like more). Once you see this Pliny-generated file in
         			 your word processor you can begin the job of rearrangine the materials, writing
         			 prose text inspired by the note materials, etc etc. Furthermore, the HTML that
         			 is generated is well-formed XML, so an XML editor might also be able to open
         			 the file.
