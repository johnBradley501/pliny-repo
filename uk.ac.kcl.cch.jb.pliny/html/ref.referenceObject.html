      <h1><a name="d1e5848">2.2.2 Reference Object</a></h1>
      <p>One can use Pliny's Annotation Area to structure and manage references
         		to notes, images, etc. References to notes appears in the Annotation area as
         		<i>reference objects</i>. In this section we describe how the reference object
         		appears, and describes its parts.
      </p>
      <p>Most of the time you will see reference objects displaying references to
         		notes, but it is also possible to see a reference object to things other than
         		notes. Here are examples of a reference to an image (on the left) and a
         		reference to a note (on the right):
      </p>
      <center><br><br><table border="0">
            <tr>
               <th>Image Reference</th>
               <th>Note Reference</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>
                  <p align="center"><img src="images/reference-img.gif"></p>
               </td>
               <td>
                  <p align="center"><img src="images/reference-note.gif"></p>
               </td>
            </tr>
         </table><br><br></center>
      <p>Note the similarities and differences. The elements of the reference
         		object are described below. However, in both reference objects one can see the
         		title area (shown in both figures in green, but the colour used depends upon
         		the type of the reference), with the title of the referenced resource in the
         		centre. The main area of the reference object shows the "content" of the
         		reference. For notes this is the note's content. For the image, a thumbnail
         		appears. For some reference objects Pliny is unable to show any content. In
         		this case, this area will be empty.
      </p>
      <h2>Parts of the Reference Object</h2>
      <p>Here are the parts of the Reference Object:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/reference-parts.gif"></p>
      <p> 
         	 
         <ul>
            <li>The reference object is divided into two major parts. The top area --
               		  shown above in dark green -- is called the <i>Title Area</i>. Below the title
               		  area is the <i>Content Area</i>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Resource Title</b>: References are used to display Pliny
               		  resources, and all Pliny resources have titles. It is the title of the
               		  referenced resource that is shown here. You can change the title of the linked
               		  resource by double clicking on it, and then editing the title as you wish. Note
               		  that the title belongs to the <i>referenced resource</i>, not to the reference
               		  itself, so if you edit the resource's name here you will find that all
               		  references to that resource will show the changed name.
            </li>
            <li><b>Contents Area</b>: In both these examples there is "content" that
               		  Pliny is able to show -- for the note it is the note text, and for the image it
               		  is a thumbnail of the image. For some kinds of data Pliny is not able to
               		  display content, in which case the content area will be empty. You can
               		  double-click on a note's content to open it for editing, but there is no way to
               		  edit the thumbnail edit -- Pliny does not provide tools to edit images.
            </li>
            <li><b>Drag Source / Object Opener</b>: The icon in the top left corner
               		  identifies the kind of object it refers too: the icon
               		  <img align="middle" src="images/icons/imageIcon.gif"> identifies an image, and the icon
               		  <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> identifies a note, for example.
               		  Other icons, for other kinds of data, might appear here. This icon also
               		  provides two functions: 
               		  
               <ol>
                  <li>It is a drag source object, and can be used in a a drag-and-drop
                     				operation to copy the reference to another reference area, and
                  </li>
                  <li>If double-clicked, it will open the object it references. In the
                     				figure above, for example, it would open the Note Editor on the note with name
                     				"Basics of Eclipse".
                  </li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Minimization Icon</b>: The top right corner contains the
               		  minimization icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/closeNote.gif">). This icon is
               		  clickable, and requests that Pliny should switch from the current expanded
               		  display to the minimised version -- the minimized display shows only the
               		  reference header. When the header is showing minimised the icon in the top
               		  right corner is the expand icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/openNote.gif">).
            </li>
            <li><b>Reference List Icon</b>: Alt-Click on this icon (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/referencersOn.gif">) to bring up the contextual menu. When
               		  the contextual menu is invoked while the pointer is pointing at the Reference
               		  List Icon, Pliny will generate a list of other resources that hold references
               		  to this object:
               <p align="center"><img src="images/reference-referent.png"></p> 
               		  
               <p>The generated menu contains a list of items (here four notes) that
                  			 refer to the original note (here "Ramsay and Rockwell ..."). In the example
                  			 above we can see that this note is referenced by notes called "Engelbartizing
                  			 the DH", "Bibliographic refernences", etc. You can click on any item in this
                  			 <i>referent list</i> to open it. Note that the current item (in which the
                  			 reference object we are now looking at is shown) will <i>not</i> appear in the
                  			 list even though it too, of course, contains a reference to this particular
                  			 note.
               </p> 
               		  
               <p>If the object does not appear in any other reference area, Pliny
                  			 will report "no items to display."
               </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Map Icon</b>: Not all references have the Map Icon in their title
               		  (Note that it does not appear in the image reference, as shown above). If it is
               		  there, however, you can click on it to switch the view between the the object's
               		  Content and its reference area. The icon here acts as a toggle. When the map
               		  icon is showing (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/showMap.gif">) you can click on
               		  it to which to the "map" view of the reference. 
               		  
               <p>The map view is a miniature reference area. When a reference is
                  			 showing the associated reference area it looks like this:
               </p>
               		  
               <p align="center"><img src="images/reference-map.gif"></p> 
               		  
               <p>Here the reference object "Basics of Eclipse" shows that this note
                  			 contains a reference to two other notes "Panels" and "Icons". You can treat
                  			 this area as any other annotation area -- you can create new notes into the
                  			 area for example. You can also drag notes from outside it or from other sources
                  			 into it or drag objects out.
               </p> 
               		  
               <p>Note that the Map icon has changed to the text contents icon
                  			 (<img align="middle" src="images/icons/showContents.gif">) when the map view is in
                  			 operation. Click here to switch back to the text contents view.
               </p>
            </li>
