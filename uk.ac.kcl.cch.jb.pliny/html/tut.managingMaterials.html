      <h1><a name="d1e2794">1.2.6 Managing Pliny materials</a></h1>
      <p>After you have used Pliny for some period of time you will find that you
         		have hundreds or even thousands of notes. In the same way that simply dropping
         		papers in your office anywhere makes it difficult to keep track of what you
         		have when your collection of papers gets large, not attending to the issue of
         		organising materials in Pliny can readily produce a collection which is
         		unusable because it is hard to find anything.
      </p>
      <p>However, the whole point of using Pliny is to assist you in keeping
         		track and organising new ideas that come into your head. You will find Pliny to
         		be helpful to you to the extent that you can organise things in it in ways that
         		match your evolving set of ideas. It is important to understand that Pliny, by
         		being an Englebartian piece of software (a word processor is "Englebartian"),
         		does not do the organising for you. In the same way that a word processor does
         		not write the text for you, but provides you with a mechanism that makes it
         		easier to write; so Pliny does not organise your materials for you, but
         		provides an environment that helps you do the job yourself. Just as some text
         		from a word processor is still yours because the intellectual materials it
         		presents was wholely created by you, the structures you create in Pliny as you
         		work over your materials are yours because you created them. Indeed, I suggest
         		that you begin to think of how to manage your notes early in your use of Pliny
         		rather than later.
      </p>
      <p>The first thing to understand here is that the key object to help you
         		organise things is, perhaps surprisingly, the Pliny Note. Although the Pliny
         		note is used in annotation because it provides a space for a bit of annotation
         		text, like all Pliny resources a note also has a 2D reference space attached to
         		it -- and the more that space is featured as the centre of attention in any
         		particular Pliny note, the more likely it will be that the note itself was not
         		created simply as an annotation to something else, but instead is a principal
         		organising object within your collection. We have, in fact, already started
         		this process when the "uses of space for study" object was created in the
         		previous tutorial <a href="tut.organisingNotes.html">using Pliny to organise
            		notes</a>.
      </p>
      <p>A second key element in Pliny that supports the development topics of
         		interest is that Pliny objects appear on a 2D space as a reference. This means
         		that the same object can appear in more than one place, and this ability to
         		have the same object appear in more than one contexts is very useful during the
         		task of representing in Pliny a developing interpretation. The following
         		figures illustrates this schematically:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/topics-tut-00.gif"></p>
      <p>The figure shows three stages of research in the yellow boxes. The first
         		stage -- reading -- is shown at the left end, and you see here represented 3
         		pieces of reading, with annotations attached to each of the three readings. The
         		second stage -- interpretation development -- is represented in the middle
         		area. There you see two topics represented as a Pliny-like 2D space. In a real
         		use of Pliny you are likely to have many more "topic" items than just two.
         		Reference objects appear in both these two topics, and some of them are
         		references to notes that were originally created as annotations to the readings
         		(the two-direction arrows are meant to show that the same note appears in both
         		places). Finally, the "writing" area on the right shows Pliny helping in the
         		preparation of two papers. Here the user is assembling materials that are
         		relevant to the papers s/he is planning. Some of these are new objects, some
         		are references to notes that were annotations made during the reading (created
         		in the left column), and some are references to topics developed during
         		interpretation, and represented in the diagram in the middle column.
      </p>
      <p>Note the recontextualising that is going on here. The topmost object in
         		Paper 1 is the same item as the top item in Topic 1, and was originally created
         		as an annotation to the third paper. Similarly, the 2nd item in Paper 1 is a
         		reference to Topic 2. It is in the constructing of objects that support reading
         		(annotations), that support interpretation development (topics), and support
         		paper writing that Pliny assists you to develop your ideas and eventually turn
         		them into materials for publication.
      </p>
      <p>Any formal system for modelling materials of course limits the kinds of
         		organisational strategy you can use -- however, I have created the model that
         		Pliny uses to store your notes in a way that is quite flexible. Thus, Pliny
         		does not impose a particular approach that you must take to organise your
         		material -- that is your business too. Indeed, you could use, simultaneously,
         		two or more different strategies to organise things if that seemed to be useful
         		to you. In this tutorial I will suggest an approach that I have found helpful,
         		but you might well find that quite a different approach could used effectively
         		if it suits your purposes better.
      </p>
      <p>As the figure above suggests, the basic idea in the structuring model I
         		propose is centered around the idea of a "topic". The "uses of space for
         		study", built in the previous tutorial, is a topic, and you might have already
         		used Pliny notes to organise more than one topic like this. There is no formal
         		object in Pliny called a "topic" -- instead the 2D reference space in a Pliny
         		note object can be used to store information about a topic and help you manage
         		it.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating a <i>My Topics</i> object
      </h2>
      <p>If you wish to organise your materials into a set of interesting
         		  topics, then you need a place to collect the topics themselves. Hence, the need
         		  for an object called "My Topics" in which references to all your topics are
         		  stored. <i>My Topics</i> can best be managed as an instance of a Pliny Note.
         		  Since the plan is to have all the topics that interest you collected together
         		  on it, this <i>My Topics</i> note is likely to be one of the major ways into
         		  your topic collection, so it makes sense to also have it as one of your
         		  Bookmarked objects.
      </p>
      <p>To create the note for <i>My Topics</i>, click on the New Note icon
         		  <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> in the top right corner of the
         		  Resource Manager:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/topics-tut-01.gif"></p>
      <p>Pliny will respond, as usual with the New Note wizard:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/topics-tut-02.gif"></p>
      <p>Of course, you have used this form before, and have seen the New Note
         		  Information box several times already, so this process to create notes is not
         		  new. Note how it has been filled in to create the <i>My Topics</i> note object
         		  above: 
         		
         <ul>
            <li>The name for the note has been given as <i>My Topics</i>.
            </li>
            <li>The <i>Add to Bookmark List?</i> tickbox has been selected.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>By ticking the "Add to Bookmark List" item we ensure that the new
         		  object is immediately put in the <i>My Bookmarks</i> list in the Resource
         		  Explorer, and, therefore, always available for quick access from there in the
         		  future.
      </p>
      <p>When the <i>Finish</i> button is clicked, the new note called <i>My
            		  Topics</i> is created, and displayed. As usual, the My Topics note editor
         		  starts off by dividing its display area in two equal sized halves. For this
         		  note the focus will be on the 2D space, so it is a good idea to move the
         		  boundary between the textual context and the 2D space to the left, to increase
         		  the size of the 2D area. It is also useful to use the textual content area as
         		  the place for a brief note explaining what this "My Topics" object is. After
         		  doing these two things the screen will look like this:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/topics-tut-03.png"></p>
      <p>Now that we have a space (to the right) to hold references to the
         		  topics that have been created, we need to put references of them on it. For
         		  instance, to add a reference to <i>uses of space for study</i>, one could look
         		  it up in the Resource Explorer, and then drag the icon that refers to it to My
         		  Topic's reference area, as shown here:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/topics-tut-04.png"></p>
      <p>When you complete the dragging operation and release the mouse button,
         		  a reference to <i>uses of space for study </i>will be added to the spot in the
         		  2D area where you placed it:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/topics-tut-05.png"></p>
      <p>You would repeat the above steps, adding other topics you have already
         		  created to the My Topics page until all your pre-existing topics were
         		  included.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating new Topics</h2>
      <p>Now that we have a My Topics note to hold references to topics of
         		  interest, we can simply create notes to store new topics on My Topics itself
         		  whenever a new topic emerges. Suppose, for instance, a new topic "hierarchical
         		  ordering and study" emerges. First, we create a new note on the My Topics area,
         		  then we name it appropriately. The new note has become the one for the new
         		  topic, and we can type in a bit of text to remind us what the object
         		  contains:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/topics-tut-06.png"></p>
      <p>To actually start adding materials to the new topic we would need to
         		  open it. The easiest way to do this is to double-click on the
         		  <img align="middle" src="images/icons/noteIcon.gif"> that appears in the top left
         		  corner of its reference here. Having done this, the note we just created is
         		  opened in Pliny's note editor, and we are ready to begin adding materials to
         		  it. Observe that the text we type into the note's reference object in <i>My
            		  Topics</i> appears in the textual content area:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/topics-tut-07.png"></p>
      <p>This is going to be a "topic" note, so we can expect to need more
         		  space for its 2D reference area, and less space for the display of the textual
         		  area. You can, as always, drag the boundary between the two areas to the left
         		  to make the reference area larger. Then you are ready to add materials about is
         		  new topic to its reference area.
